# How to Play, in a nutshell.

*See also the Glossary (page 231) and Example of Play (page 234).*

> ### This Game Runs On Tags (page 76).
> Short descriptors that say what’s true and give Power to or weaken your Hero's actions: <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black">handsome</span>, <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black">*spell of slumber*</span>, <span style="background-color: orange; color: black">*old injury*</span>, <span style="background-color: lightgreen; color: black">*charmed*</span>.

> ### Themes (page 74).
> Related sets of tags and Quests. Your Hero has four themes, each with:
> 
>> <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black">*Power tags*</span> (including the theme's title tag):
>>> **Positive tags that give Power to your actions**. They can be temporarily scratched making them unusable until recovered.
> ---
>> <span style="background-color: orange; color: black">*Weakness tags*</span>:
>>> **Negative tags that decrease the Power of your actions**. However, they allow you to mark Improve on the theme.
> ---
>> QUEST:
>>> **A motivation for the theme**, something your Hero seeks, defends, or upholds.


> ### <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black">*Story tags*</span> (page 164).
> 
> Temporary tags which can be positive or negative based on the situation, like <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black">*staff*</span> or <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black">*vantage point*</span>.
> - Removed when **scratched**.
> - **Expire** with time.
> - Recorded in backpack (if yours) or **Tracking Card** (if general).

> ### <span style="background-color: lightgreen; color: black">*Statuses*</span> (page 166).
> Tags that describe conditions with a tier from 1 (mild) to 6 (deadly or transformative), like <span style="background-color: lightgreen; color: black">*wounded-3*</span> or <span style="background-color: lightgreen; color: black">*glad-2*</span>.
> 
> - **Recorded on Tracking Cards**. Write the status tag and mark its tier on the card.
> - **Stacking**: If you gain the same or similar status again, mark the new tier on the same card. If the box for that tier is already marked, mark the box to its right. The highest marked box is the current tier.
> - **Reducing**: Move all the marked boxes a number of slots to the left (remove if below 1).
> - **Limits**: At tier 5, you are overcome by the status. At tier 6, it kills or transforms you.

> ### Hero Development (page 186).
>
> Mark **Improve** whenever one of your weakness tags is invoked. At 3 Improve, the theme gets an **Improvement** (usually, a new power tag).
> 
> Mark **Abandon** whenever you ignore or betray your Quest. At 3 Abandon, your theme is **replaced**.
> 
> Mark a **Milestone** whenever you achieve a goal of your Quest. At 3 Milestones, your theme **evolves**.
>
> Replacing or evolving a theme gains you **Promise**, which unlocks greater **Moments of Fulfillment**.

> ### The Fellowship (page 138). 
> A **shared theme** usable by any of the Heroes.
>
>> <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black">*Power tags*:</span>
>>> **Single-use** (Scratched when invoked. Cannot be burnt for Power.) Recovered during camping.
> ---
>> <span style="background-color: orange; color: black">*Weakness tags*:</span>
>>> Mark Improve on the Fellowship theme when invoked.
> ---
>> <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black">*Relationship tags*:</span> 
>>> Single-use story tags (positive or negative) each Hero has with each other Hero. Recreated during camping.

> ### During a scene. 
> Repeat the game loop – Establish - Action - Consequences – until the stakes are won, lost, or deferred, or the scene otherwise concludes. Continue to the next scene or to camping.
> #### ESTABLISH (page 146).
> **The Narrator**...
> - (Re)Describes the scene.
> - Highlights the stakes (why this scene matters).
> - Introduces **Challenges**.
> - Makes **Threats** (actions initiated by Challenges).
> - Asks the player(s) “**What do you do?**” and gives the spotlight to a Hero (different Hero each turn)
>
> #### ACTION (page 149).
> **The Hero in the spotlight describes their action.**
> **The Narrator chooses how to determine the outcome:**
> -	Simple (Narrator’s call)
> -	Quick (Roll)
> -	Detailed (Roll + Spend)
>
> #### CONSEQUENCES (page 160).
> **The Narrator can deliver Consequences if**
> -	A Threat was ignored (Challenge action materializes)
> -	The Hero’s action (roll) had Consequences
> -	The Narrator invokes a Hero’s weakness tag for Consequences (Hero marks Improve)
>
> **The Narrator decides on Consequences**
> -	Narrative
> -	Give/scratch a tag (any number of tags) or give/reduce a status (any tier). **The Hero may react**.
>
>> #### CHALLENGES (page 147).
>> Adversaries, obstacles, and dangers that put your Hero or their goals at risk.
>>
>> Challenges act against you by making Threats (during Establish) and delivering Consequences.
>>
>> You overcome Challenges with a Success (Quick) or by giving them statuses high enough to max their Limits, e.g., <span style="background-color: indianred; color: black;">*harm* **4**</span>, <span style="background-color: indianred; color: black;">*banish* **2**</span>, or <span style="background-color: indianred; color: black;">*convince* **3**</span>, (Detailed), Narrator's choice.
>
>> #### MAKING A ROLL (page 151).
>> **Count the action’s Power.**
>> Invoke relevant tags and statuses of the Hero, of the target, in the environment, etc.
>> - +/-1 Power for every positive/negative tag.
>> - +3 Power for scratching  your Hero's positive tag (Burning A Tag For Power).
>> - +/- tier of best and worst status.
>> - +/-3 Power if Favored/Imperiled due to Might (page 171) (+/-6 Power if Extremely).
>>
>> Mark Improve for every invoked weakness tag. **Roll two six-sided dice (2d6) and add Power**.
>>> 10 or more (or two 6s on the d6s): Success!
>>
>>> 7 to 9 Success & Consequences.
>>
>>> 6 or less (or two 1s on the d6s) Consequences.
>
>> #### SPENDING POWER (page 154).
>> Spend your Power on your action's **Effects** (spend 1 when Power is zero or less):
>> - Add, scratch , or recover a tag (2 Power)
>> - Give or reduce a status (1 Power per tier)
>> - Discover a valuable detail (1 Power)
>> - Extra feat in addition to other Effects (1 Power)
>> - (Add a single-use tag with last 1 Power)
>
>> #### REACTION (page 162).
>> If the Narrator allows it, **the Hero can take a reaction** to lessen Consequences at the cost of 1 Power per status tier, 2 Power per tag:
>> Describe, count Power, and roll (as in Detailed).
>> - **10 or more** (or two 6s on the d6s): Spend Power+1 on any Effect.
>> - **7 to 9**: Spend Power only to lessen.
>> - **6 or less** (or two 1s on the d6s): Take Consequences as-is.

### Camping (page 179).
The Narrator **expires story tags**.
Each Hero chooses **2 activities** (or 3 with Consequences):
- REST: Recover some statuses and scratched power tags (Narrator's call).
- REFLECT: Mark Improve on one theme.
- CAMP ACTION: Count Power and spend half of it without rolling (rounded up), or roll.
Each Hero chooses to recover a Fellowship power tag or create a new relationship tag with another Hero (max 1 per fellow Hero).
