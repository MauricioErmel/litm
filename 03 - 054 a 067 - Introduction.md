# Introduction.
## A warm welcome to you, traveler in imaginary worlds!

By opening this book, you have taken a step and crossed the misty threshold between the prosaic world of the mundane and the hidden world of legends.
With the secrets you’ll glean from these pages, you will soon weave a tale of your own. You will take your unlikely hero on journeys into foreign lands, to face challenges mighty and strange, to make great sacrifices and at long last prevail against the world’s perils – or falter and become lost to oblivion. 
May this game, one of many in the sacred tradition of storytelling and roleplaying, be a source of rich enjoyment for you and your fellow travelers and a path to the wisdom and courage hidden within you.
– The Son of Oak team.

### THIS IS A ROLE-PLAYING GAME.
*Legend in the mist* is a role-playing game. Like the fireside storytellers of old, you play it by gathering around the table, in person or online, and having **a dynamic conversation** where you tell a fantasy story, a legend.
In your story, players take on the role of **the Heroes**, choosing and describing their thoughts, feelings, actions, and sacrifices, while **the Narrator** sets the scenes, describes people, places, and fantastical beings along the journey, and enforces the timeless rule that every action taken by the Heroes has consequences.
This game also has built-in tools for playing in **solo** or **co-op** modes, where a single player playing alone or a group playing together share both the role of the Heroes and the role of the Narrator.
You use **the game rules** to propel your story forward, control the pacing and the difficulty level of the challenges faced by the Heroes, and to offer surprising outcomes to your Heroes’ actions.
In every game session, from scene to scene, you play out another chapter of the Heroes’ story, experiencing new dramatic, emotional, and exciting moments to your heart’s content!

### WHAT YOU’LL NEED TO PLAY.
#### THIS BOOK. 
This book explains the rules of the game and provides ample materials and guidance for players and Narrators for creating compelling Heroes and exciting adventures.
#### A GROUP. 
If you’re playing in a group, 2-6 players (including the Narrator) is ideal. Find players to play with among your friends, family, or other social circles, online (such as on the Son of Oak Discord server), in community centers (such as clubs or libraries), or in gaming conventions.
#### A PLACE TO PLAY. 
You can have your game sessions in person or online, such as on a video call, on Discord, on a virtual tabletop platform, or play-by-post on chat channels and forums.
#### SAFETY TOOLS. 
Role-playing games are a pastime and a hobby, so make sure everyone feels comfortable at the table. We recommend maintaining an atmosphere of respect and open discussion, and suggest using safety tools such as Lines & Veils, available online, to sync on what content is okay or not okay for your group to have in your game.
#### TOOLS & ACCESSORIES. 
At the very least, you’ll need a way to **record your notes** (pencils and papers or a digital medium) and a way to roll **two six-sided** dice (physically or digitally). Each Hero needs a copy of the **character sheet** (Hero, Theme, and Fellowship cards) found at the end of this book.
At your option, you can use these *Legend In The Mist* accessories:
- **Theme Cards** for recording your Heroes’ details.
- **Tracking Cards** for recording story tags and statuses with dry or wet erase markers.
- **Acorn Dice** (six-sided) or **River Pebble Dice** (twelve-sided dice that repeat the numbers 1 to 6 twice, so they act as six-sided dice).
- **The Narrator’s Screen** with a summary of the rules for quick reference.

### PRINCIPLES OF GOOD ROLEPLAYING.
#### PLAY FOR THE STORY.
This game isn’t competitive. While the Heroes may want to win 
the day, players and Narrator play together to spin and enjoy an entertaining yarn. Revel in the discovery and drama of every new development, whether a dreaded consequence or a wonderful success.
#### BE THE CHARACTERS’ GREATEST FAN.
You both create and follow the unfolding story of your Heroes, so let yourself get excited about their qualities, abilities, potential, failures, and growth. Portray them, their allies, and their adversaries as dynamic characters using your imagination and flair.
#### PLAY FAIR AND COLLABORATE.
Listen to one another and be respectful of each others’ boundaries. Share the spotlight, lift up your fellow Heroes, and make choices that would promote a better game for everyone at the table. Work with the Narrator and accept their rulings and the results of the dice.
#### MAKE THIS GAME YOUR OWN.
Nothing in this game is set in stone – use it in the way that’s most fun for you and your group.

### COMING FROM OTHER RPGS.
*Legend in the mist* stands out in the landscape of tabletop role-playing games as a wholly tag-based (description-based) game. If you’re coming to *Legend in the mist* after having played stat- and class-based tabletop RPGs, you’re in for a liberating treat: you’ll no longer be limited in the type of characters you can create, the actions you can take, or the stories you can tell.
Such freedom is so great that it can be jarring, so we packed this book with tools like tropes and theme kits (page 80) to help you quickly make the most of it. If you come from especially rules-heavy games, check out also the *Action Grimoire* (available where you got this book) as a reference guide on how to express the wide range of actions possible in *Legend in the mist*. 
Here are a few things to remember when you move to *Legend in the mist*:

#### THIS IS A NARRATIVE GAME.
Like in a fantasy novel, the focus is on dramatic actions, tough choices, and gripping story developments, while blurring unimportant details. For example, you don’t track exactly how much coin your character has or what exactly they’re carrying; instead, you track only the items that matter for the story.

##### IT’S BUILT TO SUPPORT BETTER STORYTELLING BY GETTING OUT OF THE WAY.
You choose when to stay in the narrative and when to get tactical. Any story beat, challenge, or conflict can be played without rolling, with a single roll (check), or as a full play-by-play encounter.

##### INITIATIVE IS DRAMATIC, NOT NUMERIC.
Heroes act in the order deemed by the Narrator based on the situation. Challenges (adversaries) don’t have their own turns – they pose threats before each Hero’s action and take actions if those threats were ignored or if the Hero fumbled.

##### CONFLICTS ARE MORE THAN JUST FIGHTS AND "DAMAGE" IS MORE THAN JUST HIT POINTS.
There is no single hit points stat – both Heroes and adversaries can take, and be overcome by, different types of conditions: physical, emotional, mental, social, mystical, or anything else. Rather than meaninglessly decreasing your health bar, these conditions have an immediate impact on your actions – both narratively and in gameplay.

##### ROLEPLAY CHOICES CAN TRANSFORM YOUR CHARACTER SHEET.
Heroes grow by gaining more abilities and becoming more powerful, but in some dramatic story moments they may sacrifice it all and undergo deep transformations. However, Hero evolution is built so that even what seems like a step back in fact makes the Hero grow, in other ways.

#### THERE ARE NO STATS, ONLY TAGS.
Your Hero, the challenges they face, and the world around them are described solely using short descriptors called tags: instead of “17 Strength”, you have rippling muscles and lifting strength. This colors every ability and action with unique narrative flavor and allows you to create any imaginable character or power set you can dream up.

##### THERE IS ONLY ONE KIND OF DICE ROLL IN THIS GAME – ONE ROLL TO RULE THEM ALL – AND IT’S POWERED BY TAGS.
It’s a 2d6 roll modified by the number of helpful tags you have for this action (and some other factors). Each action or reaction roll is characterized differently by the situation, by the tags you use to power it, and by the effects you choose as its outcome.

##### THE OUTCOME (EFFECT OR “DAMAGE”) OF YOUR ACTIONS AND YOUR ADVERSARIES’ ACTIONS IS ALSO EXPRESSED WITH TAGS.
You can give an enemy a wound tag, give an ally a buff tag, remove a negative tag from yourself, or summon or craft a new tag. Some outcomes are purely narrative and do not use tags at all.

##### THE NARRATOR AND PLAYERS DECIDE WHICH TAGS ARE RELEVANT OR IRRELEVANT FOR ANY GIVEN ACTION.
This is best done with a collaborative, clear-cut mindset at the table, where the Narrator promptly rules out tags that don’t directly affect the action and players find creative uses for tags without stretching their application too far. There are ample tools to support you with this, such as rules for indirectly relevant tags (which cost an extra action) and optional rules for capping tag numbers, as well as the Action Grimoire. 

##### ALL DICE ROLLS ARE MADE BY THE PLAYERS.
The Narrator never rolls the dice, leaving them free to direct the drama. When adversaries cause harm in a conflict, itâ€™s the Heroes who roll for a reaction. Challenges have their own tags that affect Hero rolls.

### HOW TO USE THIS BOOK.
This game book is divided into two volumes for ease of use: 
*Volume I* provides rules, tools, and options for the Hero:
- **The Tutorial** teaches you the basics of the game.
- **Chapter #1: The Makings of a Hero** walks you through creating Heroes and Fellowships.
- **Chapter #2: How To Play** explains the rules of the game, how to take actions and overcome Challenges, as well as how to evolve your Hero.
- **Chapter #3: The Secret of Magic** explains how to portray magic in the game with the basic rules and offers a few examples of advanced Ways of Magic.

*Volume II* has guides and materials for the use of the Narrator:
- **Chapter #4: The Narrator’s Role** is a detailed guide on how to run a game, how to design adventures and series, and how to create your own Ways of Magic.
- **Chapter #5: The Satchel of Perils** contains a menagerie of Challenges for the Narrator to use in your game, as well as a guide on how to create them, and a starter adventure.
- **The Oracle** is a set of tools for running solo or co-op games, where you play both as the Hero and as the Narrator.

### START HERE.
#### CHOOSE YOUR FRAME OF PLAY.
You begin by deciding on your **Frame of Play**: the setting and nature of the story you’ll tell.
Ask yourself, in what kind of world is your story set? Who are the Heroes? What brings them together? What types of challenges and dangers do they face? 
Consider the story’s themes and highlights. Will you tell of love, war, redemption? Is magic common, risky, divine?
*Legend in the Mist* is primarily a game of **rustic fantasy**, a subgenre of fantasy explained in the next pages, but it can be used to tell any fantasy tale. The following pages provide suggestions of four frames of play to build your game around, rustic or otherwise.
#### THE PROLOGUE:</br>CREATE YOUR HEROES & FELLOWSHIP.
Your Frame of Play will inform your choices as you set up your game, starting with **Hero & Fellowship Creation** on page 72.
Once your Heroes are ready, the Narrator can find additional guidelines for **Setting Up A Game** and creating adventures starting on Volume II, page 8.
#### PLAY A SESSION! 
Have the players play through the **Tutorial** (page 10) to learn the basics of the game, or briefly go over the general rules presented in **How To Play** (page 68). You can also begin playing right away with the learn-as-you-play starter adventure **The Heap-Thing Of Skunk Glen** (Volume II, page 208). If you’re playing solo or co-op, check out **The Oracle** toolset (Volume II, page 238).
Then, dive into your next adventure!

### RUSTIC FANTASY.
While you can use this game to play any fantasy story, *Legend in the Mist* is first and foremost a game of â€œrustic fantasyâ€ â€“ but what does that mean?
#### IT’S ABOUT THE SIMPLE, LITTLE THINGS.
Rustic fantasy is intimate and detailed – it tells stories in which the Heroes are moved and impressed upon by the everyday sensations around them: the smell of herbs brewing in a cauldron in the hearth; the soft snow falling on a lichen-covered stone path; a fisherman’s deft, wrinkly hands as they knot twine; or yellowing grass blades swaying in the gentle wind. There is a kind of special presence in the little things, a momentary elation of spirit.
This appreciation of detail extends to all practical aspects of life and all manner of crafts depicted in the story: handwritten recipes of decoctions, strange and specific magical laws, local folklore about creatures and their weaknesses, a carefully packed lunch for the road, or simply day-to-day sayings – these all come together to create the cozy or gritty texture of the tale.
#### IT’S ABOUT SMALL HEROES FROM OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACES WHO DISCOVER THEIR GREAT DESTINIES – OR NOT.
Often beginning in a remote rural setting, rustic tales tell the stories of those who would be “nobodies in particular” from “nowhere 
of importance”, but *something* calls them toward a greater world. Whether they are victims of circumstances or have a seed planted in them by the most mysterious of forces, and whether they remain true to their humble origins to the end of the tale or meet that great world with greatness of their own, well, that remains to be seen.
#### IT’S ABOUT SMALL HEROES FACED WITH GREAT PERILS, OFTEN BEYOND THEIR POWER OR UNDERSTANDING.
Forces of the great world outside – war and politics, greedy sorcerers, and strange monsters – penetrate the Heroes' enclosed existence and demand that they rise up to meet them. And forces of yet another, invisible world, scarcely-knowable and hidden in every little thing, steer the Heroes’ lives or observe intently from the shadows, perhaps because the fate of much greater things hangs in the balance. **All of these evoke a great sense of mystery in the face of the unknown.**

#### IT IS ABOUT JOURNEYS THROUGH THE COUNTRYSIDE AND WILDERNESS, AND LIVING CLOSE TO NATURE.
Rural living entails traveling through pastoral or wild landscapes on a regular basis because almost anything you need is far away, and every venture into the woods is a step into a realm of mystery. Beyond, the great world beckons with its tractless expanses, dense forests, and dramatic mountains. The trail, the lay of the land, the weather, and the perils along the way are all key – as are the lessons learned and the breathtaking vistas that unfold before the Heroes. What you pack matters, not so much as a list of provisions but as a reflection on who you are.
#### ULTIMATELY, RUSTIC FANTASY IS ABOUT EVOKING THAT TENDER FEELING OF THE LEGENDARY.
Nostalgic yet current, made-up yet true, a good legend manages to 
reach past the practicality and cynicism of daily life and into a place long forgotten within us, to nourish it with wisdom drawn from the universal experiences of us all, through the Heroes of the tale. It reminds us to pause and look at the Heroes’ journey from the perspective of the invisible watchers, knowing in our hearts that even though peril is imminent and the fate of the Heroes hangs in the balance – there is still hope. And that whether they rise or fall, in the end, it was a story worth telling.

### OUR LITTLE CORNER OF THE WORLD.
Your story could be centered entirely around the minute happenings 
of a small village, community, or region, with the world at large as a mere background. The stakes are always low, at least to the eyes of an outsider, but for the Heroes, the runaway sheep of the neighbor or the absentmindedness curse placed by the old grump on the village smith pose serious concerns. Plots begin rather small and seemingly inconsequential, but in time they can spiral into the creepy, dangerous, or heroic. 
- **Absence of might**: The Heroes are by and large simple people without much power.
- **No magic, or everyday practical magic**: Powerful magic, if it exists, is rare and beyond the scope of this story.
- **Wholesome rewards: Emotional rewards**: such as gaining self-esteem or the thanks of a neighbor or relative; handy everyday items; or a remarkable local discovery.
- **Detail-oriented**: What kind of cheese is it? Is the sword rusty, well-worn, or visibly crafted by an amateur?
- **Lighthearted**: Rejoice in the mundane and enjoy this hour.
- **Local cast**: Tavern clientele, village elders and leaders, neighbors near and far.
- **Short-range travel**: Journeys to an outlying farm or a friend who lives in the woods.

#### THE HEROES MIGHT BE…
**Tavern Buddies**, a whimsical version where the Heroes are a bunch of good-for-nothings thrown into local adventures for no reason other than being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
**Protectors Against the Dark**, a grimmer version where the Heroes must protect the pastoral lifestyle of their community from the encroaching perils of the outside world, such as raids, monsters, or a creeping blight.

### AN EPIC JOURNEY.
Your story could be centered around a journey undertaken as part of a greater quest or purpose. Perhaps there is imminent danger to the world or region, such as a dark tyrant or impending doom, or the fellowship is tasked with finding a rare cure or undoing a curse. Along the way, they must traverse many lands, contend with enemies most monstrous, have dealings with monarchs and strange beings, and uncover the secrets that will lead them to complete their quest. They may be called to find great ar-tifacts of old or mysterious magical powers that are the key to their quest.
- **A mixed bag of power levels**: Strong and capable Heroes, and even those with a major role to play in the coming world-drama, travel alongside wide-eyed villagers, who nevertheless are essential to the cause.
- **A mixed bag of commitment**: Every Hero may have their own reason to be on the journey.
- **Long journeys**: Through war-ravaged lands, obscure parts of the world that hold important artifacts, or to faraway strongholds in search of allies.
- **Supplies matter**: Travel is demanding and prolonged, and at times takes the Heroes to barren lands. What one carries or can forage or hunt is important.
- **Grand and lofty magic**: Magic is a slowly-revealed mystery, a journey in and of itself, and not easily accessed by many. Few if any Heroes possess it, and often the chief adversaries hold much greater magical power.
- **Alternating cast**: Every new place holds new meetings with few NPCs sticking around throughout the journey.
- **High adventure**: What new dangers and opportunities await beyond the next hill?

#### THE HEROES MIGHT BE…
**A Sworn Fellowship**, the classic epic, where the Heroes set out on a declared quest to save their home or world, fated to face the consummate evil.
**A Traveling Band**, a less epic version where the Heroes travel far and wide together for their own reasons, such as protection on the road. Or, they are performing a “mundane” task, such as mapping the West Marches or performing in every tavern in the land.

### GRIT & POLITICS.
Your story could feature a sense of gritty realism, focusing on a soci-ety driven by self-interest, a mean world that takes no prisoners, run by cutthroat politics, where a Hero’s actions have brutally realistic consequences. The Heroes travel a region rife with political, racial, and factional tensions, experiencing and at times taking part in its hardships and injustices, as they pursue their greater goals.
- **Persons of considerable ability**: The Heroes are neither
great rulers nor pitiful and powerless subjects – they are trained individuals able to survive this harsh world, for which they are sought after by both king and beggar.
- **Affiliation is key**: The Heroes are aligned with one party or another, whether they like it or not. Neutrality often demands the highest price.
- **Journeying through a social landscape**: The political situations the Heroes traverse  are key. The forest wilds may be dangerous, but uncomplicated in comparison.
- **Magic will cost ya**: Yet another component of a politically-complicated world, magic comes with strings attached or an oft-too-high price.
- **Unforgiving consequences**: Heroes may die for no good reason, especially those with good intentions; non-Heroes certainly will.

#### THE HEROES MIGHT BE…
**Itinerant Sellswords**, the grittiest version, where the Heroes unscrupulously offer a service to any who would pay, wading through gutters and visiting halls of power, to fight human monsters and monsters who show humanity. 
**A Powerful House**, a more political version, where the Heroes are a part of a ruling elite or their retinue, and play the game of thrones. Often based around one house and their stronghold.

### DUNGEON CRAWL.
Your story could focus simply on the joys of adventuring, trea-sure-seeking, and getting into fun trouble, where the Heroes are often glory-seeking oddballs and outsiders, drawn together into a found family or for practical reasons – to survive their next dun-geon delve. Journeys are more often into the dark of an under-ground tomb or a long-lost temple, where the Heroes face monsters and traps. Think of this more as a ramble than a story with a major plot arc, although it can have one.
- **Skilled adventurers**: The Heroes know their trade and are rarely untrained civilians or world-shaping powers.
- **Challenging crawls**: Journeys are ventures into complexes that are made to challenge the adventurers with traps, monsters, and riddles. The journeys between delves are not as interesting.
- **Strange people and funny moments**: Half of the fun of a dungeon adventure is arguing with a magical stone face, taking sides in a conflict between animated kitchen utensils, or getting your arm turned into jelly.
- **Utilitarian magic**: Magic is rarely mysterious – it’s just one of the tools you need in your belt when you descend into the darkness, and in your hands it often produces reliable prescribed results.
- **Loot is important**: Special weapons, armor, and gear are needed to face greater dangers and get better loot. Quirky magical items abound.

#### THE HEROES MIGHT BE…
**Fortune Hunters**, the hardcore crawling option, where the Heroes care more about reaching the treasure at the end of the dungeon than anything outside it.
**Found Family of Rascals**, a more narrative spin, where the Heroes are a collection of unusual types, oddballs, and weirdos, each with their own overly-dramatic story arc, who survive in a scornful world thanks to their talent at reaching treasure.
