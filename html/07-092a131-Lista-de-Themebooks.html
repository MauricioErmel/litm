                <h2><img class="icon-origin">Circumstance</h2>
                <h4>BACKGROUND, SOCIAL STANDING, UNIQUE SITUATION, WALK OF LIFE</h4>
                <p>With this theme, the circumstance in which you currently find yourself
                    plays a major role in your story. This could entail your social standing
                    or role, whether you are descended from nobility or born to poverty,
                    whether you are struggling to survive, hunted for who you are, being the
                    village fool nobody takes seriously, and so on. This theme type focuses
                    on where you are in life, your unique situation, whether it is inherent or
                    temporary.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is your place in life and in society?</li>
                    <li>What’s interesting about where you have found yourself?</li>
                    <li>What social position do you possess and how long have you had it?</li>
                    <li>What makes you a stereotypical example of your circumstance? What
                        makes you stand apart?</li>
                    <li>Are you a victim of circumstance or did you choose your lot in life?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Power Tag Questions</h3>
                <ol class="theme-question">
                    <li><strong>What Circumstance do you find yourself in?</strong></li>
                    <li>What tools or trappings of your position or station do you carry?</li>

                    <li>How have you learned to overcome your Circumstances?</li>
                    <li>What is the motto or creed you’ve adopted?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Weakness Tag Questions</h3>
                <ol class="theme-question">
                    <li>What’s the biggest challenge you face due to your unique position?</li>
                    <li>What aspect of your Circumstance do others scorn, shun, or detest?</li>

                    <li>How do others commonly mistreat you?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Quest Ideas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A desire to prove your worth despite your status.</li>
                    <li>An ambition to become the most successful or archetypal member of
                        your role.</li>
                    <li>A binding norm or code you adhere to due to your position.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>Comfort Zone:</strong> When you camp or sojourn in the environment of your Circumstance, you
                    may recover
                    one scratched power tag in addition to any other benefits.</p>
                <p><strong>Expected Role:</strong> Choose a status that represents how society expects you to behave,
                    such as <span class="tag-status">friendly</span>,
                    <span class="tag-status">threatening</span>, or <span class="tag-status">in-charge</span>. Once per
                    session, before you take a social action befitting your expected
                    role,
                    you may gain this status at tier 2.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Familiar Matters:</strong> There are things everyone in your situation knows. Once per scene,
                    you may ask the
                    Narrator for one important detail about a subject related to your Circumstance.</p>
                <p><strong>Strength From Adversity:</strong> Once per session, when a weakness tag from this theme is
                    invoked, you may
                    gain <span class="tag-status">driven-2</span>, which helps this roll and expires after it.</p>
                <p><strong>Trudging Along:</strong> Choose a type of status that you’ve become accustomed to given your
                    Circumstance, such
                    as <span class="tag-status">tired</span> or <span class="tag-status">humiliated</span>. Once per
                    scene, you may ignore a status you have of that type if it is tier
                    3 or
                    lower.</p>

                    to go back to when the adventures are over, and serves as a framework

                <h3>Quest Ideas</h3>
                <ul class="quest-ideas">
                    <li>A simple statement of your Devotion and what you feel towards them or it.</li>
                    <li>Something you hope to gain by your Devotion, the one thing you cling
                        to that makes all this sacrifice worthwhile.</li>
                    <li>A task you must complete for your Devotion, such as a ritual, a
                        pilgrimage, or an act of heroism.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> When your Devotion or a person representing it takes Consequence, you may
                    take it
                    instead of them (and possibly react to it), if the Narrator deems it possible.</p>
                <p><strong>Catch Me When I Fall:</strong> Once per session, when you act with the object of your
                    Devotion or a person
                    representing it at your side, and the outcome is only Consequences, you may choose to Succeed as
                    well.</p>
                <p><strong>Deeply Committed:</strong> Your dedication fills you with purpose. Once per scene, when you
                    take action to
                    pursue this theme’s Quest, you may first gain <span class="tag-status">committed-2</span>, which
                    expires after that action.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Goes Both Ways:</strong> Once per session, if the object of your Devotion is near, you may
                    gain a story tag
                    representing aid granted by them, such as an item, encouragement, knowledge, or direct help.</p>
                <p><strong>Unwavering:</strong> Once per session, when a tag in this theme would be scratched for any
                    reason, you may
                    keep it unscratched instead.</p>

                    EXPERIENCE, TRAUMA OR WINDFALL</h4>
                <p>Something happened to you that still echoes through your life and
                    defines you, shapes you, or haunts you. You may have been through
                    something traumatic or life altering, which left its mark on you.
                    Perhaps it was one fateful day that changed everything or a whole
                    secret history or a prior life you’ve left behind, or it could be a period of
                    time that left an impression on you, such as an education you acquired

                    <li>What repercussions of that experience still haunt you?</li>
                    <li>Are you trying to return to the better days, or hoping to leave the past

                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>Face From The Past:</strong> Once per session, when you meet a character from your Past
                    for
                    the first time in
                    the game, you may describe how your last meeting went and give them an appropriate tier-2
                    status.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> Once per session, when you roll a total of 6 or less, you may
                    explain how this
                    situation is familiar to you from your Past, reroll the dice, and take the new result.</p>
                <p><strong>Not Letting Go:</strong> Whenever you burn a tag from this theme for Power, you can mark
                    Abandon on any
                    other theme instead of marking that tag as scratched.</p>
                <p><strong>Put It Behind Me:</strong> When you Make a Sacrifice at the Scarring sacrifice level, you
                    may
                    forego the roll
                    and treat it as a 7-9 instead, Success with Consequences. You must choose to replace this theme.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Vivid Memory:</strong> Once per session, when a weakness tag from this theme is invoked,
                    you
                    may discover
                    (ask the Narrator) or reveal (decide yourself, Narrator approves) one important detail from your
                    Past
                    and gain an appropriate story tag or a tier-2 emotional status.</p>

                    other group who are their own culture or ancestry. You were born into
                    this community or you joined later in life, whether by choice or due to

                    you
                    socially interact

                <p><strong>Stand Out:</strong> You are an unusual member of your People. Once per scene, when
                    you

                    against your
                    People’s habits, culture, or traditions and get both a Success and Consequences, you may
                    choose
                    not
                    to
                    take the Consequences.</p>
                <p><strong>True To My Tribe:</strong> You are an exemplary member of your People. Once per
                    scene,

                    acting
                    according to your People’s habits, culture, or traditions would put you at risk or
                    disadvantage
                    and
                    you
                    still choose to do so, you may mark Improve on this theme.</p>
                <p><strong>Trust in Legacy:</strong> Choose one power tag describing your People’s abilities or
                    ways.
                    Once per session,
                    when you roll with this tag and get only Consequences, you may choose to Succeed as well.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Wisdom Handed Down:</strong> You command the lore of your People. Once per scene, you
                    may
                    ask
                    the
                    Narrator for one important detail from an area of knowledge possessed by your People.</p>

                <h4>TEMPERAMENT, PERSONAL “AURA” OR STYLE, COMMON BEHAVIOR, INNER SELF</h4>
                <p>You have a certain way of seeing the world and engaging with it,
                    an archetypal personality type or way about you. You might have
                    developed it during your younger years, or adopted it only lately, and
                    it might not even be to your liking – but your personality is taking you
                    places and defines how you interact with others. It could be that when
                    times get tough, your true self comes out. Or maybe your persona is just
                    a crutch, a defense that keeps people from getting too close.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are you like?</li>
                    <li>What made you this way?</li>
                    <li>How well does your personality mesh with others’?</li>
                    <li>Is it all a show you’re putting on for the world? And if so, what’s
                        beneath it?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Power Tag Questions</h3>
                <ol class="theme-question">
                    <li><strong>What Personality trait is most central to you?</strong></li>
                    <li>In what situations does your Personality truly shine?</li>
                    <li>How do you influence other people?</li>
                    <li>What item or garment best expresses your personal style?</li>
                    <li>What interpersonal or social skill or talent do you possess?</li>
                    <li>When in trouble or stressed, what emotion or behavior do you turn to?</li>
                    <li>What is an unexpected but useful facet of your Personality?</li>
                    <li>How do you support or help others?</li>
                    <li>How do you resist influence or stay true to yourself?</li>
                    <li>How can your unique worldview help you figure things out?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Weakness Tag Questions</h3>
                <ol class="theme-question">
                    <li>In what situations does your Personality get you into trouble?</li>
                    <li>What is an ugly or unfortunate aspect of your Personality?</li>
                    <li>What unwanted behavior does your Personality push you toward?</li>
                    <li>Who finds you, or who do you find, irksome or loathsome?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Quest Ideas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A personal motto, rhyme, or quote that encompasses your core
                        worldview or approach.</li>
                    <li>Something you must do to feel true to yourself.</li>
                    <li>A goal you have set for yourself due to your Personality.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>Adaptable Persona:</strong> Once per session, when you take an action using tags from
                    this
                    theme and get
                    only Consequences, you may choose to Succeed as well.</p>
                <p><strong>Big Personality:</strong> When you burn power tags from this theme for Power, they
                    add 4
                    Power instead of 3.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Infectious Personality:</strong> When you camp or sojourn, you may give another Hero
                    a
                    story
                    tag describing
                    an aspect of your Personality (expiring any previous tag created this way).</p>
                <p><strong>Lasting Impression:</strong> Once per scene, when you take a social action and
                    Succeed,
                    you
                    may give a <span class="tag-power">lasting impression</span> to everyone you affect with this
                    action.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Unshakeable:</strong> Once per scene, when you react to lessen social or emotional
                    Consequences and get a
                    total result of 7 or above, you may spend all your Power to completely avoid all Consequence
                    Effects.</p>

                <h4>CRAFT, HOBBY, TALENT OR KNACK, PROFESSION, PRACTICED OR REHEARSED ABILITY</h4>
                <p>You have a skill or ability you are somewhat good at, developed through
                    practice or daily application over time. Or perhaps you’ve acquired a trade,
                    which is more than a single honed skill – it’s a set of related techniques
                    and understandings, with its own role in society. You might have learned
                    a profession from a mentor, put to work in your family’s farm or shop, or
                    practiced by yourself due to personal interest or out of necessity. You have
                    become fairly good at what you do, and can trust your skills to carry you
                    forward in most everyday situations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How did you acquire this skill or trade?</li>
                    <li>What are its everyday needs? What tools do you use?</li>
                    <li>How do others look upon you as a practitioner of this skill?</li>
                    <li>How do you keep your skills honed?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Power Tag Questions</h3>

                    <h3>Weakness Tag Questions</h3>
                    <ol class="theme-question">
                        <li>What challenge or feat is quite beyond your everyday ability?</li>
                        <li>What conditions make it harder for you to practice your Skill or Trade?</li>

                    <h3>Quest Ideas</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The motivation to practice your Skill or Trade, such as to earn a living.</li>
                        <li>A professional standard you are held to or a line you try not to cross.</li>
                        <li>A desire to become much better at this than you are presently.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                    <p><strong>Deft Remedy</strong>: Once per session, when you use tags from this theme and
                        roll a
                        total of
                        6 or less, you
                        may reroll the dice and take the new result instead.</p>
                    <p><strong>Learn from My Mistakes</strong>: Once per scene, when you act using tags from
                        this
                        theme
                        and
                        don’t Succeed,
                        mark Improve on this theme.</p>
                    <p><strong>Practice Makes Perfect</strong>: Choose a helpful status reflecting your use
                        of
                        your
                        expertise such as alert or
                        <span class="tag-status">well-off</span>. You may burn a tag from this theme at any time to gain
                        that status at tier
                        3.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Rehearsed Technique</strong>: When you choose this Special, choose a power
                        tag
                        from
                        this
                        theme. Whenever
                        you burn that tag for Power, you gain 3 Power as normal and may also forgo rolling
                        the
                        dice
                        and
                        treat
                        the dice roll total as 7 (before adding Power).</p>
                    <p><strong>Resourceful</strong>: When you camp or sojourn, if you dedicate your time to
                        preparing or
                        crafting something
                        using your skill, you may create an extra story tag in addition to the usual
                        benefits.

                <h4>PHYSICAL FEATURE, MENTAL QUALITY, SPECIAL GIFT</h4>
                <p>You have a specific innate attribute that defines you, whether in your
                    physique, your mind, or your heart – for example, you are strong,
                    covered in scales, large-bodied, beautiful, cunning, or quick. Or, you
                    possess some kind of special quality, unique to you, although not
                    terribly out of the ordinary, such as being loved by animals. It could
                    be something you were always well-known for while growing up or a
                    recent transformation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When did you first discover or become aware of your trait?</li>
                    <li>How reliant on this trait are you? Do you neglect developing relevant
                        skills, or is it so good you simply don’t need to?</li>
                    <li>Who around you came to appreciate or resent this trait?</li>

                    Before you lies a difficult task, a path rife with tribulations, or the
                    heavy burden of responsibility, and you must steel yourself if you are to
                    accomplish what you set out to achieve. Luckily, such an undertaking
                    often means you have the backing of an organization, a person of
                    interest, a faction, or even a deity who may believe in your cause or

                <p>You possess knowledge that is beyond what is known and
                    commonplace and which grants you a deeper understanding of the
                    world. You may be innately attuned to deeper understanding, the last
                    in a line of keepers who pass on their sacred songs, or an inquisitive
                    or scholarly mind who has amassed a body of knowledge through
                    experience or studies. Perhaps it was passed down to you in a dusty

                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>Known Expert</strong>: People seek your advice. Once per session, you may
                    gain an
                    audience
                    with any NPC
                    interested in your Knowledge (Narrator’s call), without rolling, or remove from

                    camp or sojourn,
                    you may choose to spend your time thinking instead of resting. If you do, you
                    gain
                    the
                    benefit

                <p><strong>Inventive Stroke</strong>: Whenever you invoke this theme’s title tag

                    your
                    Knowledge to a
                    practical task in a way you never have before, you get 2 Power from the tag
                    instead
                    of
                    1.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Flashes of Insight</strong>: Whenever you encounter for the first time a
                    place,
                    object,
                    creature or phenomenon
                    that your Knowledge applies to, you may ask the Narrator to give you one
                    valuable
                    detail
                    about
                    it.

                <h4>ITEM OF MAGICAL OR SPIRITUAL POWER, STRANGE HEIRLOOM, ADVANCED ARTIFACT</h4>
                <p>You possess an item of power or a mysterious artifact, which
                    changed your life. Its enchanted nature cannot be denied –
                    at least not by you – and its power guides or influences your
                    decisions and actions. It might be a source of arcane power, a
                    container for a spirit, or a relic of a bygone age. Whether you
                    deserve, need, or are capable of controlling this power might not
                    be important. You already have it. What you'll do and where it'll
                    take you are the real questions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What does your relic look like? What kind of item is it?</li>
                    <li>Was your relic a gift, an heirloom, a chance discovery?</li>
                    <li>How obvious is its magic and how far-reaching are its effects?</li>
                    <li>Does it have a will of its own? Is it opinionated? Is it cursed?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Power Tag Questions</h3>
                <ol class="theme-question">
                    <li><strong>What powerful or mysterious item do you possess?</strong></li>
                    <li>What is its most potent power or ability?</li>
                    <li>What is another aspect or part of its magic?</li>
                    <li>What do you feel when you hold, wear, or use it?</li>
                    <li>When does your Relic come to life or becomes stronger?</li>
                    <li>What skill is required to best handle the Relic?</li>
                    <li>Who or what was your Relic made to affect the most?</li>
                    <li>What is revealed to you through the use of your Relic?</li>
                    <li>What is a secret feature of the Relic that no one else knows about?</li>
                    <li>What does your Relic unlock or unleash?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Weakness Tag Questions</h3>
                <ol class="theme-question">
                    <li>What is the most troublesome shortcoming of your Relic?</li>
                    <li>What can interfere with the powers of your Relic?</li>
                    <li>What can damage or destroy your Relic?</li>
                    <li>What has changed in you for the worse because of your Relic?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Quest Ideas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A task you must accomplish related to your Relic, such as to keep it
                        working.</li>
                    <li>A vision or destiny the item pushes you towards or even requires
                        you to fulfill.</li>
                    <li>A responsibility that comes with this item’s power, or a behavior it
                        enables.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>Eternal Bond</strong>: You can scratch a power tag from this theme to
                    immediately
                    retrieve
                    your Relic from
                    anywhere in the world. You can mark Abandon on this theme to immediately
                    remove
                    all
                    statuses
                    from
                    your Relic or reform it.</p>
                <p><strong>Momentary Bearer</strong>: Once per session, you can let another
                    player
                    use
                    power
                    tags
                    from
                    this theme,
                    provided they can access and use your Relic for their action.</p>
                <p><strong>Reckless Discharge</strong>: Once per session, when you act using
                    tags
                    from
                    this
                    theme,
                    you
                    may treat the
                    theme as if it was one level of Might higher than it is. Mark Abandon on
                    this
                    theme.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Sentinel</strong>: Choose a tier-2 status that describes how your
                    Relic
                    protects
                    you,
                    such as
                    <span class="tag-status">watchful-2</span>,
                    <span class="tag-status">parrying-2</span>, <span class="tag-status">warded-2</span>, or
                    <span class="tag-status">cover-2</span>. You may gain it once per session, when you
                    are
                    in
                    imminent
                    danger.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Signature Move</strong>: Choose a power tag from this theme and an
                    appropriate
                    tier-2
                    status
                    that you can
                    give using this tag. Once per session, when you use this tag in an action
                    and
                    Succeed,
                    you
                    may
                    give
                    this
                    status in addition to (and after applying) the normal outcome.</p>

                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>As Foretold:</strong> Once per session, you may declare an action by
                    you
                    or
                    another
                    Hero
                    as
                    pivotal in the
                    fulfillment of your Destiny. Count Power normally and, instead of rolling,
                    treat
                    the
                    result
                    as a
                    Success
                    with Consequences.</p>
                <p><strong>Meet It Head-On:</strong> Once per session, when you act against
                    something
                    preventing
                    you
                    from fulfilling
                    your Destiny, you first gain a story tag or a tier-2 status that represents
                    your
                    readiness.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Not How It Ends:</strong> Once per session, when you take
                    Consequences
                    that
                    would
                    hinder
                    you
                    on the way to
                    your Destiny (<span class="tag-status">despaired</span>, <span class="tag-status">tired</span>,
                    <span class="tag-status">cursed</span>, etc.), you may avoid these
                    Consequences
                    completely.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Reincarnation:</strong> When your Destiny finally manifests, you may
                    remove
                    any
                    harmful
                    status on you,
                    including tier-6 statuses. This theme evolves, and you can replace any
                    number of
                    your
                    other
                    themes.
                    You gain Promise as usual for all themes.</p>
                <p><strong>Pull of Destiny:</strong> Once per session, you may ask the Narrator
                    what
                    the
                    best
                    way to
                    pursue your Destiny
                    is, and get one valuable detail.</p>

                <h4>LAND OR KINGDOM, AUTHORITY OVER A PEOPLE,
                    AN ORGANIZATION, OR A PART OF SOCIETY</h4>
                <p>You are an overlord, ruling over a land or leading a people, a
                    nation, or a vast organization. The weight of this responsibility
                    is heavy and your days are troubled by many grave concerns, but
                    those who bear it can affect great changes in the world. Perhaps
                    you have been chosen, ordained, or elected, or perhaps you seized
                    your place by force. Wherever the case, you now contend with
                    threats to your throne and to your territory.</p>

                    <li>What do you rule over and how did you achieve this position?</li>
                    <li>What power do you wield through your position and what are its

                        immediate circle?</li>

                        yourself?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>Embodiment of the Realm</strong>: You are connected to your Dominion
                    in
                    more
                    than
                    title.
                    Any
                    status on your
                    Dominion is considered to apply to you as well, and any status on you is
                    considered
                    to
                    apply
                    to
                    your
                    Dominion.</p>
                <p><strong>Good Help Is Hard to Find</strong>: Name an advisor, craftsman, or
                    assistant
                    NPC
                    that
                    comes
                    with your
                    position. Once per session, you may gain a story tag they produce for you.
                </p>
                <p><strong>My Word Is Absolute</strong>: Once per session, you may gain a story
                    tag
                    representing
                    a
                    decree you have made
                    in your Dominion (expiring any previous tag created this way). White it
                    exists,
                    it
                    holds
                    true
                    throughout
                    your Dominion, although it can be scratched.</p>
                <p><strong>Regalia</strong>: Choose a physical symbol of your position. Once per
                    scene,
                    when
                    you
                    wear,
                    wield, or are in the
                    presence of this symbol, you may gain <span class="tag-status">majestic-2</span>.</p>
                <p><strong>Untarnished Glory</strong>: Once per session, you may remove 2 tiers
                    of a
                    negative
                    status
                    on

                </ul>
                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>Always Prepared:</strong> Once per scene, when a broad tag from this
                    theme is
                    indirectly
                    relevant to your
                    action, you may use it as directly relevant instead, skipping the required
                    prep
                    action.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Calculated Sacrifice:</strong> Before Making a Sacrifice at the Grave
                    sacrifice
                    level
                    related
                    to your Mastery,
                    replace a theme other than this one that is dearest to you. You may then
                    treat a
                    7-9
                    roll as
                    a
                    10 or
                    more
                    result. If you Succeed, you don’t need to replace another theme – you
                    already
                    paid
                    that
                    price.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Foresee the Outcome:</strong> Once per session, you may declare that
                    an
                    action in
                    which
                    you
                    rolled a total of 9
                    or less (including Power) was only a prediction of an unwanted outcome and
                    did
                    not
                    actually
                    happen.
                    Disregard the action and take a different action instead.</p>
                <p><strong>Lifelong Insight:</strong> When you replace this theme, you may keep
                    one
                    of
                    the
                    Special
                    Improvements you
                    chose (except for this one) and add it to the new theme.</p>
                <p><strong>Second Wind:</strong> Once per session, you may restore two scratched
                    tags in
                    this
                    theme,
                    at
                    the cost of
                    scratching one tag on another theme.</p>
