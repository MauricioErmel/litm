                <h4>BACKGROUND, SOCIAL STANDING, UNIQUE SITUATION, WALK OF LIFE</h4>
                <p>With this theme, the circumstance in which you currently find yourself
                    plays a major role in your story. This could entail your social standing
                    or role, whether you are descended from nobility or born to poverty,
                    whether you are struggling to survive, hunted for who you are, being the
                    village fool nobody takes seriously, and so on. This theme type focuses
                    on where you are in life, your unique situation, whether it is inherent or
                    temporary.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is your place in life and in society?</li>
                    <li>What’s interesting about where you have found yourself?</li>
                    <li>What social position do you possess and how long have you had it?</li>
                    <li>What makes you a stereotypical example of your circumstance? What
                        makes you stand apart?</li>
                    <li>Are you a victim of circumstance or did you choose your lot in life?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Power Tag Questions</h3>
                <ol class="theme-question">
                    <li><strong>What Circumstance do you find yourself in?</strong></li>
                    <li>What tools or trappings of your position or station do you carry?</li>

                    <li>What is the motto or creed you’ve adopted?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Weakness Tag Questions</h3>
                <ol class="theme-question">
                    <li>What’s the biggest challenge you face due to your unique position?</li>

                </ol>
                <h3>Quest Ideas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A desire to prove your worth despite your status.</li>
                    <li>An ambition to become the most successful or archetypal member of
                        your role.</li>
                    <li>A binding norm or code you adhere to due to your position.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>Comfort Zone:</strong> When you camp or sojourn in the environment of your Circumstance, you
                    may recover
                    one scratched power tag in addition to any other benefits.</p>
                <p><strong>Expected Role:</strong> Choose a status that represents how society expects you to behave,
                    such as friendly,
                    threatening, or in-charge. Once per session, before you take a social action befitting your expected
                    role,
                    you may gain this status at tier 2.</p>
                <p><strong>Familiar Matters:</strong> There are things everyone in your situation knows. Once per scene,
                    you may ask the
                    Narrator for one important detail about a subject related to your Circumstance.</p>
                <p><strong>Strength From Adversity:</strong> Once per session, when a weakness tag from this theme is
                    invoked, you may
                    gain driven-2, which helps this roll and expires after it.</p>
                <p><strong>Trudging Along:</strong> Choose a type of status that you’ve become accustomed to given your
                    Circumstance, such
                    as tired or humiliated. Once per scene, you may ignore a status you have of that type if it is tier
                    3 or
                    lower.</p>

                <ul class="quest-ideas">
                    <li>A simple statement of your Devotion and what you feel towards them or it.</li>
                    <li>Something you hope to gain by your Devotion, the one thing you cling
                        to that makes all this sacrifice worthwhile.</li>
                    <li>A task you must complete for your Devotion, such as a ritual, a
                        pilgrimage, or an act of heroism.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> When your Devotion or a person representing it takes Consequence, you may
                    take it
                    instead of them (and possibly react to it), if the Narrator deems it possible.</p>
                <p><strong>Catch Me When I Fall:</strong> Once per session, when you act with the object of your
                    Devotion or a person
                    representing it at your side, and the outcome is only Consequences, you may choose to Succeed as
                    well.</p>
                <p><strong>Deeply Committed:</strong> Your dedication fills you with purpose. Once per scene, when you
                    take action to
                    pursue this theme’s Quest, you may first gain committed-2, which expires after that action.</p>
                <p><strong>Goes Both Ways:</strong> Once per session, if the object of your Devotion is near, you may
                    gain a story tag
                    representing aid granted by them, such as an item, encouragement, knowledge, or direct help.</p>
                <p><strong>Unwavering:</strong> Once per session, when a tag in this theme would be scratched for any
                    reason, you may
                    keep it unscratched instead.</p>

                    <p>Something happened to you that still echoes through your life and

                        secret history or a prior life you’ve left behind, or it could be a period of
                        time that left an impression on you, such as an education you acquired

                    <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                    <p><strong>Face From The Past:</strong> Once per session, when you meet a character from your Past
                        for
                        the first time in
                        the game, you may describe how your last meeting went and give them an appropriate tier-2
                        status.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> Once per session, when you roll a total of 6 or less, you may
                        explain how this
                        situation is familiar to you from your Past, reroll the dice, and take the new result.</p>
                    <p><strong>Not Letting Go:</strong> Whenever you burn a tag from this theme for Power, you can mark
                        Abandon on any
                        other theme instead of marking that tag as scratched.</p>
                    <p><strong>Put It Behind Me:</strong> When you Make a Sacrifice at the Scarring sacrifice level, you
                        may
                        forego the roll
                        and treat it as a 7-9 instead, Success with Consequences. You must choose to replace this theme.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Vivid Memory:</strong> Once per session, when a weakness tag from this theme is invoked,
                        you
                        may discover
                        (ask the Narrator) or reveal (decide yourself, Narrator approves) one important detail from your
                        Past
                        and gain an appropriate story tag or a tier-2 emotional status.</p>

                        <p>You have a certain way of seeing the world and engaging with it,

                            developed it during your younger years, or adopted it only lately, and
                            it might not even be to your liking – but your personality is taking you
                            places and defines how you interact with others. It could be that when
                            times get tough, your true self comes out. Or maybe your persona is just
                            a crutch, a defense that keeps people from getting too close.</p>

                        <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                        <p><strong>Adaptable Persona:</strong> Once per session, when you take an action using tags from
                            this
                            theme and get
                            only Consequences, you may choose to Succeed as well.</p>
                        <p><strong>Big Personality:</strong> When you burn power tags from this theme for Power, they
                            add 4
                            Power instead of 3.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Infectious Personality:</strong> When you camp or sojourn, you may give another Hero
                            a
                            story
                            tag describing
                            an aspect of your Personality (expiring any previous tag created this way).</p>
                        <p><strong>Lasting Impression:</strong> Once per scene, when you take a social action and
                            Succeed,
                            you
                            may give a lasting
                            impression to everyone you affect with this action.</p>
                        <p><strong>Unshakeable:</strong> Once per scene, when you react to lessen social or emotional
                            Consequences and get a
                            total result of 7 or above, you may spend all your Power to completely avoid all Consequence
                            Effects.</p>

                                    6 or less, you
                                    may reroll the dice and take the new result instead.</p>

                                <p><strong>Practice Makes Perfect</strong>: Choose a helpful status reflecting your use
                                    of
                                    your

                                    well-off. You may burn a tag from this theme at any time to gain that status at tier
                                    3.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Rehearsed Technique</strong>: When you choose this Special, choose a power
                                    tag
                                    from

                                    theme. Whenever
                                    you burn that tag for Power, you gain 3 Power as normal and may also forgo rolling
                                    the
                                    dice
                                    and
                                    treat
                                    the dice roll total as 7 (before adding Power).</p>
                                <p><strong>Resourceful</strong>: When you camp or sojourn, if you dedicate your time to
                                    preparing or
                                    crafting something
                                    using your skill, you may create an extra story tag in addition to the usual
                                    benefits.

                                    interest, a faction, or even a deity who may believe in your cause or
