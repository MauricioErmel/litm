                <h4>BACKGROUND, SOCIAL STANDING, UNIQUE SITUATION, WALK OF LIFE</h4>
                <p>With this theme, the circumstance in which you currently find yourself
                    plays a major role in your story. This could entail your social standing
                    or role, whether you are descended from nobility or born to poverty,
                    whether you are struggling to survive, hunted for who you are, being the
                    village fool nobody takes seriously, and so on. This theme type focuses
                    on where you are in life, your unique situation, whether it is inherent or
                    temporary.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is your place in life and in society?</li>
                    <li>What’s interesting about where you have found yourself?</li>
                    <li>What social position do you possess and how long have you had it?</li>
                    <li>What makes you a stereotypical example of your circumstance? What
                        makes you stand apart?</li>
                    <li>Are you a victim of circumstance or did you choose your lot in life?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Power Tag Questions</h3>
                <ol class="theme-question">
                    <li><strong>What Circumstance do you find yourself in?</strong></li>
                    <li>What tools or trappings of your position or station do you carry?</li>

                    <li>What is the motto or creed you’ve adopted?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Weakness Tag Questions</h3>
                <ol class="theme-question">
                    <li>What’s the biggest challenge you face due to your unique position?</li>

                </ol>
                <h3>Quest Ideas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A desire to prove your worth despite your status.</li>
                    <li>An ambition to become the most successful or archetypal member of
                        your role.</li>
                    <li>A binding norm or code you adhere to due to your position.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>Comfort Zone:</strong> When you camp or sojourn in the environment of your Circumstance, you
                    may recover
                    one scratched power tag in addition to any other benefits.</p>
                <p><strong>Expected Role:</strong> Choose a status that represents how society expects you to behave,
                    such as friendly,
                    threatening, or in-charge. Once per session, before you take a social action befitting your expected
                    role,
                    you may gain this status at tier 2.</p>
                <p><strong>Familiar Matters:</strong> There are things everyone in your situation knows. Once per scene,
                    you may ask the
                    Narrator for one important detail about a subject related to your Circumstance.</p>
                <p><strong>Strength From Adversity:</strong> Once per session, when a weakness tag from this theme is
                    invoked, you may
                    gain driven-2, which helps this roll and expires after it.</p>
                <p><strong>Trudging Along:</strong> Choose a type of status that you’ve become accustomed to given your
                    Circumstance, such
                    as tired or humiliated. Once per scene, you may ignore a status you have of that type if it is tier
                    3 or
                    lower.</p>

                    <li>A simple statement of your Devotion and what you feel towards them or it.</li>
                    <li>Something you hope to gain by your Devotion, the one thing you cling

                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> When your Devotion or a person representing it takes Consequence, you may
                    take it
                    instead of them (and possibly react to it), if the Narrator deems it possible.</p>
                <p><strong>Catch Me When I Fall:</strong> Once per session, when you act with the object of your
                    Devotion or a person
                    representing it at your side, and the outcome is only Consequences, you may choose to Succeed as
                    well.</p>
                <p><strong>Deeply Committed:</strong> Your dedication fills you with purpose. Once per scene, when you
                    take action to
                    pursue this theme’s Quest, you may first gain committed-2, which expires after that action.</p>
                <p><strong>Goes Both Ways:</strong> Once per session, if the object of your Devotion is near, you may
                    gain a story tag
                    representing aid granted by them, such as an item, encouragement, knowledge, or direct help.</p>
                <p><strong>Unwavering:</strong> Once per session, when a tag in this theme would be scratched for any
                    reason, you may
                    keep it unscratched instead.</p>

                <p>You have a specific innate attribute that defines you, whether in your
                    physique, your mind, or your heart – for example, you are strong,
                    covered in scales, large-bodied, beautiful, cunning, or quick. Or, you
                    possess some kind of special quality, unique to you, although not
                    terribly out of the ordinary, such as being loved by animals. It could
                    be something you were always well-known for while growing up or a
                    recent transformation.</p>

            this will hurt later, jealous
            spectators, stretching my luck,
            harder when restrained
            I can make that jump.
            TRAIT
            Prophetic Visions
            find the place I saw, anticipate

            enemies’ plan, direct the vision,
            sense unnatural presences, parlor
            tricks, lie about how I know
            paranoid, susceptible to
            possession, use it for personal
            gain, protective hexes
            Where do these visions
            come from, and why do
            they come to me?
            TRAIT

            exhausting, reinforced steel
            The only way to get stronger

            Beauty is but a distracting
            glamor; it is not who I truly am.

            treasure, gills-concealing scarf
            dive too deep, feared by
            drylanders, strong or large
            prey, uneasy on dry land
            Nowhere do I feel more
            at home than deep in
            the murky water.

                    Before you lies a difficult task, a path rife with tribulations, or the
                    heavy burden of responsibility, and you must steel yourself if you are to
                    accomplish what you set out to achieve. Luckily, such an undertaking
                    often means you have the backing of an organization, a person of
                    interest, a faction, or even a deity who may believe in your cause or

                <h4>ITEM OF MAGICAL OR SPIRITUAL POWER + STRANGE HEIRLOOM + ADVANCED ARTIFACT</h4>
                <p>You possess an item of power or a mysterious artifact, which
                    changed your life. Its enchanted nature cannot be denied –
                    at least not by you – and its power guides or influences your
                    decisions and actions. It might be a source of arcane power, a
                    container for a spirit, or a relic of a bygone age. Whether you
                    deserve, need, or are capable of controlling this power might not
                    be important. You already have it. What you'll do and where it'll
                    take you are the real questions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What does your relic look like? What kind of item is it?</li>
                    <li>Was your relic a gift, an heirloom, a chance discovery?</li>
                    <li>How obvious is its magic and how far-reaching are its effects?</li>
                    <li>Does it have a will of its own? Is it opinionated? Is it cursed?</li>

                <p>This theme indicates one or more of your belongings play a key role in
                    your story. Whether it’s an old heirloom of your lost noble family, or

                    your role, you carry one or more items that see a lot of use. You might
                    be emotionally attached to this particular piece of equipment, possibly
                    working to maintain or improve it, or it could be expandable (or a
                    consumable) and easily replaced.</p>
