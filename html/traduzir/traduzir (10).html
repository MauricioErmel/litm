        <h2><img class="icon-adventure">Knowledge</h2>
        <h4>LORE, HIDDEN OR SECRET KNOWLEDGE, MYSTICAL INSIGHT</h4>
        <p>You possess knowledge that is beyond what is known and
            commonplace and which grants you a deeper understanding of the
            world. You may be innately attuned to deeper understanding, the last
            in a line of keepers who pass on their sacred songs, or an inquisitive
            or scholarly mind who has amassed a body of knowledge through
            experience or studies. Perhaps it was passed down to you in a dusty
            tome or perhaps you see it written in the stars above.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is it that you know that most people do not?</li>
            <li>How did you come across this knowledge?</li>
            <li>How did discovering this knowledge change you and your perception
                of the world?</li>
            <li>Who else seeks this knowledge? Do they know you have it?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Power Tag Questions</h3>
        <ol class="theme-question">

            <li>What subject do you specialize in within your body of Knowledge?</li>
            <li>What can be understood, analyzed, or explained with your Knowledge?</li>
            <li>What is a practical application of your Knowledge?</li>
            <li>What advantage do you have over those lacking your Knowledge?</li>
            <li>How do you protect, store, or preserve your Knowledge?</li>
            <li>What have you learned that is adjacent to your Knowledge?</li>
            <li>What do you always carry with you, because of what you know?</li>
            <li>What is your method of collection, discovery, or research?</li>
            <li>What is a new frontier of Knowledge you are beginning to explore?</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Weakness Tag Questions</h3>
        <ol class="theme-question">
            <li>What are the biggest holes in your body of Knowledge?</li>
            <li>What is beyond fathom, obscured, or confusing to you?</li>
            <li>Who seeks to steal, take, or deny this Knowledge from you?</li>
            <li>What hurdles stand in your way when you attempt to apply your
                Knowledge?</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Quest Ideas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A desire to discover more and deepen your Knowledge.</li>
            <li>A warning about this Knowledge, why it must be kept secret, or
                preserved.</li>
            <li>The impetus that drove you to learn all that you did.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
        <p><strong>Known Expert</strong>: People seek your advice. Once per session, you may
            gain an
            audience
            with any NPC
            interested in your Knowledge (Narrator’s call), without rolling, or remove from
            them
            up
            to 3
            status
            tiers representing hostility or resistance.</p>
        <p><strong>Always Thinking</strong>: You’re used to contemplating while doing other
            things.
            When
            you
            camp or sojourn,
            you may choose to spend your time thinking instead of resting. If you do, you
            gain
            the
            benefit
            of
            a rest, but you do not recover any Health or Stress.</p>

        <p><strong>Always Thinking</strong>: You’re used to contemplating while doing other
            things.
            When
            you
            camp or sojourn,
            you may take an action in the third period using only tags from this theme
            without
            automatically
            suffering Consequences (if you choose to roll, you may still suffer
            Consequences).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Applied Expertise</strong>: Once per session, when you spend Power to
            discover a
            valuable
            detail after rolling
            with
            tags from this theme, you may gain a free story tag representing a practical
            application
            of
            your
            discovery.</p>
        <p><strong>Inventive Stroke</strong>: Whenever you invoke this theme’s title tag
            while
            applying
            your
            Knowledge to a
            practical task in a way you never have before, you get 2 Power from the tag
            instead
            of
            1.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Flashes of Insight</strong>: Whenever you encounter for the first time a
            place,
            object,
            creature or phenomenon
            that your Knowledge applies to, you may ask the Narrator to give you one
            valuable
            detail
            about
            it.
