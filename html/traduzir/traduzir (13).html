        <h4>SUPERNATURAL CREATURE OR SPECIES, CURSED OR TRANSFORMED PERSON, SPIRIT OR

        </h4>
        <p>You are a supernatural creature or entity, born out of magic or
            belonging to a realm beyond the mundane. As such, you possess
            abilities that exceed those of human beings but you are also bound
            by your own limitations, owing to your anatomy, essence, and
            nature. Perhaps you are a spirit manifested from the otherworld
            or sent from a celestial realm, a twisted monster begotten through
            dark sorcery, or a lingering soul of the deceased.</p>

            <li>Were you born, created, cursed, or transformed into your
                uncanny existence?</li>
            <li>How similar is your appearance to that of a human? Can anyone
                tell you’re not human at a glance?</li>
            <li>Do you wish to become something else?</li>
        </ul>

                <li>What can you do that a human never could?</li>
                <li>What other magic or supernatural ability do you possess?</li>

                </li>
