        <h2><img class="icon-origin">Skill or Trade</h2>
        <h4>CRAFT, HOBBY, TALENT OR KNACK, PROFESSION, PRACTICED OR REHEARSED ABILITY</h4>
        <p>You have a skill or ability you are somewhat good at, developed through
            practice or daily application over time. Or perhaps you’ve acquired a trade,
            which is more than a single honed skill – it’s a set of related techniques
            and understandings, with its own role in society. You might have learned
            a profession from a mentor, put to work in your family’s farm or shop, or
            practiced by yourself due to personal interest or out of necessity. You have
            become fairly good at what you do, and can trust your skills to carry you
            forward in most everyday situations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How did you acquire this skill or trade?</li>
            <li>What are its everyday needs? What tools do you use?</li>
            <li>How do others look upon you as a practitioner of this skill?</li>
            <li>How do you keep your skills honed?</li>
        </ul>

                <li>How does your practice or talent bias your perceptions or interactions?</li>
                <li>Where or when are those of your Trade unwelcome or unwilling to work?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Quest Ideas</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The motivation to practice your Skill or Trade, such as to earn a living.</li>
                <li>A professional standard you are held to or a line you try not to cross.</li>
                <li>A desire to become much better at this than you are presently.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
            <p><strong>Deft Remedy</strong>: Once per session, when you use tags from this theme and
                roll a
                total of
                6 or less, you
                may reroll the dice and take the new result instead.</p>
            <p><strong>Learn from My Mistakes</strong>: Once per scene, when you act using tags from
                this
                theme
                and
                don’t Succeed,
                mark Improve on this theme.</p>
            <p><strong>Practice Makes Perfect</strong>: Choose a helpful status reflecting your use
                of
                your
                expertise such as alert or
                <span class="tag-status">well-off</span>. You may burn a tag from this theme at any time to gain
                that status at tier
                3.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Rehearsed Technique</strong>: When you choose this Special, choose a power
                tag
                from
                this
                theme. Whenever
                you burn that tag for Power, you gain 3 Power as normal and may also forgo rolling
                the
                dice
                and
                treat
                the dice roll total as 7 (before adding Power).</p>
            <p><strong>Resourceful</strong>: When you camp or sojourn, if you dedicate your time to
                preparing or
                crafting something
                using your skill, you may create an extra story tag in addition to the usual
                benefits.
