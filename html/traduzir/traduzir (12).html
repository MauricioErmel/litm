        <h4>ITEM OF MAGICAL OR SPIRITUAL POWER, STRANGE HEIRLOOM, ADVANCED ARTIFACT</h4>
        <p>You possess an item of power or a mysterious artifact, which
            changed your life. Its enchanted nature cannot be denied –
            at least not by you – and its power guides or influences your
            decisions and actions. It might be a source of arcane power, a
            container for a spirit, or a relic of a bygone age. Whether you
            deserve, need, or are capable of controlling this power might not
            be important. You already have it. What you'll do and where it'll
            take you are the real questions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What does your relic look like? What kind of item is it?</li>
            <li>Was your relic a gift, an heirloom, a chance discovery?</li>
            <li>How obvious is its magic and how far-reaching are its effects?</li>
            <li>Does it have a will of its own? Is it opinionated? Is it cursed?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Power Tag Questions</h3>
        <ol class="theme-question">
            <li><strong>What powerful or mysterious item do you possess?</strong></li>
            <li>What is its most potent power or ability?</li>
            <li>What is another aspect or part of its magic?</li>
            <li>What do you feel when you hold, wear, or use it?</li>
            <li>When does your Relic come to life or becomes stronger?</li>
            <li>What skill is required to best handle the Relic?</li>
            <li>Who or what was your Relic made to affect the most?</li>
            <li>What is revealed to you through the use of your Relic?</li>
            <li>What is a secret feature of the Relic that no one else knows about?</li>
            <li>What does your Relic unlock or unleash?</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Weakness Tag Questions</h3>
        <ol class="theme-question">
            <li>What is the most troublesome shortcoming of your Relic?</li>
            <li>What can interfere with the powers of your Relic?</li>
            <li>What can damage or destroy your Relic?</li>
            <li>What has changed in you for the worse because of your Relic?</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Quest Ideas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A task you must accomplish related to your Relic, such as to keep it
                working.</li>
            <li>A vision or destiny the item pushes you towards or even requires
                you to fulfill.</li>
            <li>A responsibility that comes with this item’s power, or a behavior it
                enables.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
        <p><strong>Eternal Bond</strong>: You can scratch a power tag from this theme to
            immediately
            retrieve
            your Relic from
            anywhere in the world. You can mark Abandon on this theme to immediately
            remove
            all
            statuses
            from
            your Relic or reform it.</p>
        <p><strong>Momentary Bearer</strong>: Once per session, you can let another
            player
            use
            power
            tags
            from
            this theme,
            provided they can access and use your Relic for their action.</p>
        <p><strong>Reckless Discharge</strong>: Once per session, when you act using
            tags
            from
            this
            theme,
            you
            may treat the
            theme as if it was one level of Might higher than it is. Mark Abandon on
            this
            theme.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Sentinel</strong>: Choose a tier-2 status that describes how your
            Relic
            protects
            you,
            such as
            <span class="tag-status">watchful-2</span>,
            <span class="tag-status">parrying-2</span>, <span class="tag-status">warded-2</span>, or
            <span class="tag-status">cover-2</span>. You may gain it once per session, when you
            are
            in
            imminent
            danger.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Signature Move</strong>: Choose a power tag from this theme and an
            appropriate
            tier-2
            status
            that you can
            give using this tag. Once per session, when you use this tag in an action
            and
            Succeed,
            you
            may
            give
            this
            status in addition to (and after applying) the normal outcome.</p>
