        <h2><img class="icon-origin">Personality</h2>
        <h4>TEMPERAMENT, PERSONAL “AURA” OR STYLE, COMMON BEHAVIOR, INNER SELF</h4>
        <p>You have a certain way of seeing the world and engaging with it,
            an archetypal personality type or way about you. You might have
            developed it during your younger years, or adopted it only lately, and
            it might not even be to your liking – but your personality is taking you
            places and defines how you interact with others. It could be that when
            times get tough, your true self comes out. Or maybe your persona is just
            a crutch, a defense that keeps people from getting too close.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What are you like?</li>
            <li>What made you this way?</li>
            <li>How well does your personality mesh with others’?</li>
            <li>Is it all a show you’re putting on for the world? And if so, what’s
                beneath it?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Power Tag Questions</h3>
        <ol class="theme-question">

            <li>How do you influence other people?</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>Weakness Tag Questions</h3>
        <ol class="theme-question">
            <li>In what situations does your Personality get you into trouble?</li>
            <li>What is an ugly or unfortunate aspect of your Personality?</li>
            <li>What unwanted behavior does your Personality push you toward?</li>
            <li>Who finds you, or who do you find, irksome or loathsome?</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Quest Ideas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A personal motto, rhyme, or quote that encompasses your core
                worldview or approach.</li>
            <li>Something you must do to feel true to yourself.</li>
            <li>A goal you have set for yourself due to your Personality.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
        <p><strong>Adaptable Persona:</strong> Once per session, when you take an action using tags from
            this
            theme and get
            only Consequences, you may choose to Succeed as well.</p>
        <p><strong>Big Personality:</strong> When you burn power tags from this theme for Power, they
            add 4
            Power instead of 3.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Infectious Personality:</strong> When you camp or sojourn, you may give another Hero
            a
            story
            tag describing
            an aspect of your Personality (expiring any previous tag created this way).</p>
        <p><strong>Lasting Impression:</strong> Once per scene, when you take a social action and
            Succeed,
            you
            may give a <span class="tag-power">lasting impression</span> to everyone you affect with this
            action.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Unshakeable:</strong> Once per scene, when you react to lessen social or emotional
            Consequences and get a
            total result of 7 or above, you may spend all your Power to completely avoid all Consequence
            Effects.</p>
