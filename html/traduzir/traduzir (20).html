        <h5>Variable Might Themebook</h5>
        <h2>Possessions</h2>
        <h4>EQUIPMENT AND GEAR, ONE SPECIAL ITEM, BELONGINGS, ASSETS</h4>
        <p>This theme indicates one or more of your belongings play a key role in
            your story. Whether it’s an old heirloom of your lost noble family, or
            simply a serviceable toolkit or sword that you need in order to perform
            your role, you carry one or more items that see a lot of use. You might
            be emotionally attached to this particular piece of equipment, possibly
            working to maintain or improve it, or it could be expandable (or a
            consumable) and easily replaced.</p>
