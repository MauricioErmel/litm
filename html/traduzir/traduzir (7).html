        <h2><img class="icon-origin">Trait</h2>
        <h4>PHYSICAL FEATURE, MENTAL QUALITY, SPECIAL GIFT</h4>
        <p>You have a specific innate attribute that defines you, whether in your
            physique, your mind, or your heart – for example, you are strong,
            covered in scales, large-bodied, beautiful, cunning, or quick. Or, you
            possess some kind of special quality, unique to you, although not
            terribly out of the ordinary, such as being loved by animals. It could
            be something you were always well-known for while growing up or a
            recent transformation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When did you first discover or become aware of your trait?</li>
            <li>How reliant on this trait are you? Do you neglect developing relevant
                skills, or is it so good you simply don’t need to?</li>
            <li>Who around you came to appreciate or resent this trait?</li>
            <li>What can this trait help you achieve?</li>
        </ul>
