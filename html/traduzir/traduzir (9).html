        <h2><img class="icon-adventure">Influence</h5>
            <h4>KEY POSITION + AUTHORITY OVER OTHERS + CONTACTS & AGENTS + PERSONAL POWER</h5>
                <p>You are an individual of considerable import, whether publicly or
                    behind the scenes, and as such you command a degree of power and
                    influence. This could be owing to your impressive presence or winning
                    character, but it just as well could be a result of years of scheming,
                    making the right connections, or influencing others in unsavory or
                    even unnatural ways.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the nature of the influence you possess?</li>
                    <li>Do others follow you willingly or begrudgingly?</li>
                    <li>What did you have to undertake or sacrifice to get to this position?
                    </li>
                    <li>How far are you willing to go to keep your power?</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Power Tag Questions</h3>
                <ol class="theme-question">
                    <li><strong>What gives you power and Influence over others?</strong></li>
                    <li>What is the most common task or service people do for you?</li>
                    <li>Who are your followers, servants, foot soldiers, or agents?</li>
                    <li>What is the most potent way in which you exert Influence?</li>
                    <li>In what domain is your Influence the strongest?</li>

                <ol class="theme-question">

                    <li>What do you do that undermines your own power?</li>
                    <li>Who does your Influence cause you to clash with?</li>
                    <li>What lies outside of your sphere of Influence?</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Quest Ideas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The reason or motivation for which you’ve accumulated all this
                        Influence.</li>
                    <li>The attitude or worldview that allowed you to gain power or maintain
                        it.</li>
                    <li>A standard of power you measure yourself by.</li>
                    <li>A decree or quest you’ve been given by a higher authority.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
                <p><strong>Follow Me!:</strong> Once per session, when you roll to recruit,
                    muster, or
                    rally
                    someone
                    under your Influence
                    and Succeed, you may create multiple single-use story tags (page 165) for 1
                    Power
                    each.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Friends Everywhere:</strong> When you enter a settlement for the
                    first time,
                    you
                    gain
                    a
                    <span class="tag-power">useful contact</span> there. You
                    may name them and define their relationship with you at the Narrator’s
                    discretion.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Long Reach:</strong> Once per session, you can have a representative
                    of your
                    Influence be
                    present anywhere
                    they could conceivably be, and then take action as that character using tags
                    from
                    this
                    theme.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Overextend:</strong> Whenever you roll with tags from this theme and
                    suffer a
                    status
                    as a
                    Consequence, you
                    may increase the tier of that status by 1 and gain 2 more Power to spend on
                    Effects.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Read Between the Lines:</strong> Whenever you roll a reaction using
                    tags from
                    this
                    theme
                    to
                    lessen a social or
                    influence-related Consequence, you receive one valuable detail about the
                    source of
                    the
                    Consequence.
