            practicing
            magic
            of
            the
            same
            kind you
            practice, you may ask the Narrator for one valuable detail about the magic
            they’re
            performing.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Ward Breaker</strong>: Once per session, when you act against someone
            warded
            against
            your
            Magic and
            they succeed on their defense, you may choose to ignore the ward and treat
            the
            action as
            if
            they
            had
            failed.</p>
