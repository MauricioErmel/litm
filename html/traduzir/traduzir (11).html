        <h2><img class="icon-adventure">Prodigious Ability</h2>
        <h4>RARE GIFT, REMARKABLE PROFICIENCY OR CAPABILITY, ASTOUNDING FEATS</h4>
        <p>With enough practice and raw talent, the line between natural ability
            and learned methods blurs until only excellence remains. You are a
            most skillful and capable exemplar of your art or ability, showing
            a rare measure of proficiency and style. Feats that seem impossible
            to beginners are routine exercises for you, and you are equipped to
            overcome the hardest challenges of your profession or pursuit. Your
            ability is a source of admiration and envy, and you are widely considered
            to be one of the best in the region, whether because you publicly shame
            the competition or thanks to circulating legends of your deeds.</p>

            <li>Are you proud of your hard-earned skills, or angry that you were
                forced to learn what you wish you didn’t have to?</li>
            <li>Are you dismissive of people beneath your level of expertise?</li>
        </ul>
