        <h2><img class="icon-greatness">Monstrosity</h2>
        <h4>ENORMOUS SIZE, SUPREME INNATE POWER OR ABILITY, ARCANE BEING</h4>
        <p>You are a creature of legend, a being of such power and immensity that
            none dare oppose you – except those rare few who are as mighty as
            you. You wield magic with ease, your essence infused with it, allowing
            you to do the impossible, to be the impossible. You are a truly fantastic
            creature in a world that fears or exalts your very existence, where your
            very footfall resounds as the bells of destiny.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What makes you so powerful compared to others?</li>
            <li>What is your relationship with the simple people of the land?</li>
            <li>Where are you most at home? What is most precious to you?</li>
            <li>What great schemes do you plot, or what deep need drives you?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
        <p><strong>Display of Force</strong>: Once per session, when you act using tags
            from
            this
            theme
            and
            Succeed without
            Consequences, your incredible display gives a tier-3 status of your choice
            representing
            amazement,
            respect, or fear to a crowd of impressionable onlookers or one observer not
            easily
            impressed.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Fine Control</strong>: You learned how to better control your form’s
            unique
            abilities.
            Choose
            and gain a Special
            Improvement from the Mastery themebook.</p>
        <p><strong>Invulnerability</strong>: Choose a power tag in this theme
            representing a
            type of
            physical or
            magical protection.
            You ignore all Consequences that this protection is relevant to, as long as
            this
            tag
            is
            unscratched.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Magical Trace</strong>: At the end of a scene, you may leave behind a
            <span class="tag-power">magical trace</span>
            (expiring
            any previous tag
            created this way). You may scratch this tag to take an action using tags
            from
            this
            theme
            as
            if
            you
            were
            at the tag’s location.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Surge of Power</strong>: Once per session, when burning a tag from
            this
            theme
            for
            Power,
            you
            may add 5 Power
            to the roll instead of 3. After the roll is resolved, you take <span class="tag-status">exhausted-2</span>.
            You
            cannot
            lessen
            this
            status.</p>
