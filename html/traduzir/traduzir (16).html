        </ul>
        <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
        <p><strong>Always Prepared:</strong> Once per scene, when a broad tag from this
            theme is
            indirectly
            relevant to your
            action, you may use it as directly relevant instead, skipping the required
            prep
            action.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Calculated Sacrifice:</strong> Before Making a Sacrifice at the Grave
            sacrifice
            level
            related
            to your Mastery,
            replace a theme other than this one that is dearest to you. You may then
            treat a
            7-9
            roll as
            a
            10 or
            more
            result. If you Succeed, you don’t need to replace another theme – you
            already
            paid
            that
            price.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Foresee the Outcome:</strong> Once per session, you may declare that
            an
            action in
            which
            you
            rolled a total of 9
            or less (including Power) was only a prediction of an unwanted outcome and
            did
            not
            actually
            happen.
            Disregard the action and take a different action instead.</p>
        <p><strong>Lifelong Insight:</strong> When you replace this theme, you may keep
            one
            of
            the
            Special
            Improvements you
            chose (except for this one) and add it to the new theme.</p>
        <p><strong>Second Wind:</strong> Once per session, you may restore two scratched
            tags in
            this
            theme,
            at
            the cost of
            scratching one tag on another theme.</p>
