        <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
        <p><strong>As Foretold:</strong> Once per session, you may declare an action by
            you
            or
            another
            Hero
            as
            pivotal in the
            fulfillment of your Destiny. Count Power normally and, instead of rolling,
            treat
            the
            result
            as a
            Success
            with Consequences.</p>
        <p><strong>Meet It Head-On:</strong> Once per session, when you act against
            something
            preventing
            you
            from fulfilling
            your Destiny, you first gain a story tag or a tier-2 status that represents
            your
            readiness.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Not How It Ends:</strong> Once per session, when you take
            Consequences
            that
            would
            hinder
            you
            on the way to
            your Destiny (<span class="tag-status">despaired</span>, <span class="tag-status">tired</span>,
            <span class="tag-status">cursed</span>, etc.), you may avoid these
            Consequences
            completely.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Reincarnation:</strong> When your Destiny finally manifests, you may
            remove
            any
            harmful
            status on you,
            including tier-6 statuses. This theme evolves, and you can replace any
            number of
            your
            other
            themes.
            You gain Promise as usual for all themes.</p>
        <p><strong>Pull of Destiny:</strong> Once per session, you may ask the Narrator
            what
            the
            best
            way to
            pursue your Destiny
            is, and get one valuable detail.</p>
