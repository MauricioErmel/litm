        <h2><img class="icon-greatness">Dominion</h2>
        <h4>LAND OR KINGDOM, AUTHORITY OVER A PEOPLE,
            AN ORGANIZATION, OR A PART OF SOCIETY</h4>
        <p>You are an overlord, ruling over a land or leading a people, a
            nation, or a vast organization. The weight of this responsibility
            is heavy and your days are troubled by many grave concerns, but
            those who bear it can affect great changes in the world. Perhaps
            you have been chosen, ordained, or elected, or perhaps you seized
            your place by force. Wherever the case, you now contend with
            threats to your throne and to your territory.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What do you rule over and how did you achieve this position?</li>
            <li>What power do you wield through your position and what are its
                limits?</li>
            <li>Who can you trust and who do you fear from within your
                immediate circle?</li>
            <li>Where do you stand between playing intrigue and staying true to
                yourself?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Power Tag Questions</h3>

            <li>What dark secret do you hide?</li>

        <h3>Quest Ideas</h3>

            <li>Your oath or primary charge as a holder of such a high station.</li>
            <li>The goal you’ve decided on as what you’d like to accomplish with
                all your power.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Special Improvements</h3>
        <p><strong>Embodiment of the Realm</strong>: You are connected to your Dominion
            in
            more
            than
            title.
            Any
            status on your
            Dominion is considered to apply to you as well, and any status on you is
            considered
            to
            apply
            to
            your
            Dominion.</p>
        <p><strong>Good Help Is Hard to Find</strong>: Name an advisor, craftsman, or
            assistant
            NPC
            that
            comes
            with your
            position. Once per session, you may gain a story tag they produce for you.
        </p>
        <p><strong>My Word Is Absolute</strong>: Once per session, you may gain a story
            tag
            representing
            a
            decree you have made
            in your Dominion (expiring any previous tag created this way). White it
            exists,
            it
            holds
            true
            throughout
            your Dominion, although it can be scratched.</p>
        <p><strong>Regalia</strong>: Choose a physical symbol of your position. Once per
            scene,
            when
            you
            wear,
            wield, or are in the
            presence of this symbol, you may gain <span class="tag-status">majestic-2</span>.</p>
        <p><strong>Untarnished Glory</strong>: Once per session, you may remove 2 tiers
            of a
            negative
            status
            on
            your Dominion or
            recover a scratched tag in this theme.</p>
