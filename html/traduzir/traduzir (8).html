        <h2><img class="icon-adventure">Duty</h2>
        <h4>OATH, GRAND OR DAUNTING QUEST, UNDERTAKING, RESPONSIBILITY</h4>
        <p>You have undertaken a task or committed yourself to an ideal with an
            earnestness that most cannot muster. You might have stepped up to
            this challenge or had it thrust upon you – either way, it is now yours.
            Before you lies a difficult task, a path rife with tribulations, or the
            heavy burden of responsibility, and you must steel yourself if you are to
            accomplish what you set out to achieve. Luckily, such an undertaking
            often means you have the backing of an organization, a person of
            interest, a faction, or even a deity who may believe in your cause or
            stand to gain from your success.</p>

            <li>What have you given up to gain and keep this level of responsibility?</li>
        </ul>
