        THE GENERAL STORE
        Every Hero begins with one tag in their backpack and may
        acquire additional tags during the game, whether by taking
        actions to obtain or purchase items, or by receiving tags from
        the Narrator based on the developments in the story, such as
        when finding a buried chest full of treasure.
        The tags in your backpack are story tags (page 164) and expire after a
        while when it makes sense in the story, such as when your item needs
        maintenance or replenishment. You then must recreate the tag to retain
        its advantage. Remember, your backpack tags represent what items are
        important for the story, so not every item you carry needs a tag.
        This section offers some suggestions of tags you can pick out for your first
        tag or obtain during the game.
        Armor
        Armor tags improve your reaction roll when you lessen the Consequences
        of attacks. Decide with your group whether you use different types of
        armor tags for flavor only, where every tag equally adds to your Power,
        or in a more realistic and tactical manner, where the armor’s description
        determines when the tag applies and when it does not.

        LIGHT ARMOR
        • Buff coat, gambeson, or arming doublet, a thickly padded leather coat.
        Worn on its own, often by hunters or foot soldiers, it offers flexibility
        and protects the wearer from slashes and glancing arrows, but not
        from direct thrusts or clear shots. Worn under heavier armor, it
        improves overall protection and prevents chafing.
        • Leather armor or boiled leather armor, is a flexible and versatile armor
        that can somewhat reduce the harm from blades and arrows but does
        little to stop a direct hit. Easier to make but clumsier and smellier is the
        unprocessed hide armor.
        • Jack of plates or brigandine, is a leather armor reinforced with metal
        inserts. Often worn over a padded armor (see above), it offers greater
        protection.
        HEAVY ARMOR
        Heavy armor tags can apply to a greater range of defensive reactions,
        but also hinder actions that require range of motion or lightness, such as
        swimming. These armors are costly, and some require rare expertise or
        advanced facilities to make. Often, they also require personal fitting by
        the armorsmith.
        • Cuirass, two pieces of armor of various materials covering the chest and
        back, or breastplate, the front part, often paired with other armor pieces
        like greaves or pauldrons.
        • Chainmail, made of hundreds of tiny metal links, or the long shirt
        of chainmail called hauberk which sometimes includes a hood,
        provides protection against all but the most powerful attacks, such as
        crossbow bolts and charging lance thrusts. It is also inefficient against
        bludgeoning weapons.
        • Plate armor, heavy and solid metal armor, further padded and
        reinforced with cloth, leather, and chainmail.
        • Mail & plate, a combination of chainmail and plate armor that provides
        heavy protection with some flexibility.
        • Helm, a helmet made of leather or metal protecting the head. The more
        it covers, the more it constricts hearing and sight.
        SHIELDS
        • Buckler, a small shield used to deflect melee strikes, but which offers
        little protection against projectiles (unless wielded by someone
        uncannily fast!).
        • Simple wooden shield, simple to make and offers protection from the front.
        • Heavy shield, a bulky metal or metal-banded wood shield, some even as
        tall as a soldier.
        Consider also which important colors, badges, emblems, or motifs adorn
        your armor or shield. Your kingdom’s sacred symbol, family heraldry, or
        patron animal may be emblazoned upon it, allowing you to be identified on
        the battlefield, and show who and what you stand for.

        Assistance
        Hired help, enthusiastic followers, distant family members, or fellow
        travelers on the same boat can all prove useful by giving advice,
        providing expertise, or simply being another set of hands. Some require
        regular payment, while others might move on or eventually lose interest
        in you or your cause.
        • Attendant, issued by the local leader to take care of you during your stay.
        • Boat handler, paid to take you down the river and avoid the dangers.
        • Fairy servant, conjured for a day and a night.
        • Informant, delivering stolen secrets; spreading misinformation will cost
        more.
        • Local guide, will show you around for a coin and a tale.
        • Mule, stubborn but brave, with a strong back to carry supplies or the
        injured.
        • Storyteller, a bard and performer, committing your tale to history.
        • Torchbearer, because someone needs to hold the torch (or lantern) and
        walk ahead.
        Clothing & Accessories
        Clothes play a role in social interactions and may denote one’s status
        and place in life. High or low, you are judged by how you dress, and
        what you wear can open doors or shut them. Different regions develop
        different styles, and markings such as pins, choice of feathers, or sewn
        decorations can tell much about your hometown and profession.
        • Bracers, wrist protection common among archers.
        • Cape, dramatically showing your status or flamboyance.
        • Court dress, fine clothing worn at court.
        • Gloves, offering warmth and protection for your hands when working.
        • Jewelry, lavishly exhibiting your wealth.
        • Jerkin or tunic, simple or luxurious long shirts.
        • Oilskins, clothing made waterproof by treating it with oil, wax, and gum.
        • Sturdy boots, ready for the outdoors.
        • Surcoat, a long heavy coat, perhaps showing your house colors.
        • Travel cloak, keeping you warm when riding.
        • Vestments, traditional garb of religious or political figures.

        Medicinal Items
        You never know when an injury, an illness, or even a simple yet serious
        discomfort might befall you. The following are usually treated as
        consumables (page 165).
        • Antidote, a medicine prepared to counteract a specific poison or venom.
        • Bandages can help an open wound heal and keep it from festering.
        • Foot ointment helps alleviate pain after hours of striding through a
        muddy swamp.
        • Healing brew, a catch-all medicine that greatly hastens natural healing.
        • Healing potion, a rare but magical concoction that can instantly heal
        most injuries.
        • Poison, a substance that harms whoever consumes it, slowly or rapidly,
        and could be fatal.
        • Sleep stone, believed to help with insomnia when placed under a pillow.
        • Sleeping drug, a substance that puts whoever consumes it to sleep.
        • Soothing salves relax itchiness and other irritations.
        • Tonic, an invigorating and stimulating beverage that helps overcome
        tiredness.
        Notes
        Your backpack holds any story tag you hold onto, and these can include
        stories you know, memories you cherish, or tricks you prepared. Like most
        thoughts, they eventually fade.
        • Directions to (choose), learned from a map or given by a local.
        • Funny anecdote, to get in someone’s graces or defuse a situation.
        • Juicy gossip, heard on the docks, or squeezed out with a drink.
        • Leftover meal recipe, taught by an innkeeper, to make do with what you have.
        • Little prayer, copied off a wayside shrine, to provide hope or perhaps luck.
        • Memory of sweet smelling bread, to lean on when comfort is needed.
        • Strong comeback, to silence an upstart who dares to insult you.
        • Unsolvable conundrum, thought up during a restless night, useful for
        distractions.
        Personal Items
        Your personal trinkets or loved memorabilia can get you through tough times.
        These can connect back to your past and help you gain perspective in the quiet
        moments. Others provide simple utility or occasionally offer confidence.
        • Biased dice, a set of dice that roll unfairly.
        • Family signet, for making wax seals or proving your descent from a
        major house.
        • Grandmother’s shawl, warm and full of comforting smells.
        • Parchment & ink, for penning missives and field notes.
        • Pipe & tobacco, for when you need to sit and think.
        • Shaving kit, making yourself presentable.
        • Small trophy, a tooth, bone, or patch of scales from your initiation as a
        hunter.
        • War paint, to blend in with your clan or proclaim your readiness for battle.

        Spiritual & Magical Trinkets
        In places where magic or superstition is common, people make small
        items invested with their beliefs or with a bit of supernatural power. The
        actual utility of such a trinket depends on the kinds of magic that exist in
        your setting.
        • Fortune telling tools, carved bones, rune-covered stones, tea leaves,
        painted cards, etc.
        • Good luck charm, a hard-to-find plant or intricately crafted tchotchke.
        • Prayer beads, a physical means of easily counting prayers.
        • Religious icon, a display of faith.
        • Scrying mirror, an expensive means of unlocking clairvoyant powers.
        • Spirit-warding symbol, a seal of protection.
        • Talisman of spiritual power, a small depiction of an important spirit.
        • Wand, a short stick for controlling spells.
        Supplies & Travel Gear
        Every journey presents its own perils, and it can be difficult to know
        what to pack. It also greatly depends on whether you’re on foot or on
        horseback, with a cart or a caravan, or on a boat. Starting out, think
        about how much you’d be willing to carry on your back and what might
        keep you from being agile in an ambush, or during a storm. What might
        you eschew, knowing that you could do some foraging on the road?
        • Bedroll, warm and soft, at least softer than the ground.
        • Carving knife, personal utensil for stabbing and slicing meat and bread.
        • Cloth tent, complete with rope, hammer, and pitons.
        • Frying pan, for preparing food or as defensive weapons in a pinch.
        • Repair kit, a needle, thread, spare buckles, and small tools for fixing gear.
        • Signal whistle, for secret codes or just alerting companions.
        • Soap & cloth, for washing up.
        • Spyglass, for scoping out threats.
        • Travel provisions, such as food, water, and mount feed.
        • Waterskin or wineskin, a sealed hide container.

        Weaponry
        The world is dangerous, whether you’re facing beasts in the wild,
        robbers in an alley, or the armies of the dead. And yet, many young
        adventurers can only afford to arm themselves with the tools of their
        trade and perhaps a family weapon at their side. Think about what
        you might be able to scrounge up in your home and your community
        when setting out.
        As with Armors (see page 132), decide with your group how
        detailed you’d like to go when applying weapon tags.
        • Axe, be it a woodcutter’s axe or a double edged battle axe.
        • Bludgeoning weapons such as clubs, cudgels, hammers, and maces.
        • Bow, carefully crafted ranged weapons, such as hunting bows,
        longbows, and recurve bows.
        • Dirk, a long knife or dagger, good for stabbing and throwing alike.
        • Flail, a handle attached to a chain-linked striking end, to fling over
        shields.
        • Polearm, long-handled weapons with a blade or point, such as
        spears, halberds, and pikes.
        • Slingshot, easily made tool for launching rocks, fruits, and other
        annoyances.
        • Staff, such as a quarterstaff, shepherd’s crook, or perhaps a wizard’s staff.
        • Sword, stick them with the pointy end: shortsword, longsword,
        arming sword, curved sword, scimitar, saber, and many other types.
        • Two-handed, great weapons such as greatswords, flamberge swords,
        great axes, and warhammers.
        You can use additional tags to describe your weapon and give it
        character: well-balanced, fine craftsmanship, back scabbard, sharpened
        and oiled, consecrated, etched dedication, and so on.
        Coin
        The exact amount of money your Hero is carrying is never tracked,
        in the same way Heroes in stories rarely count their treasure coin
        by coin. Your Hero is assumed to have monetary resources that are
        reasonable for a person of their background and means, as reflected
        in their themes and backstory. If they are journeying, their means
        generally depend on what they had when they left home, what they
        found since, and what they’ve spent.
        Tags that represent valuables such as bag of gold or precious gem can
        highlight your Hero’s purchasing possibilities. You and the Narrator may
        also use a financial status, such as hefty-purse or short-on-coin, to indicate
        the temporary condition of your Hero having more or less to spend.
        See buying and selling (page 185) for more about purchasing actions.
