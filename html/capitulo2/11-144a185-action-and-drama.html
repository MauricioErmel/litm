        <h1>Action & Drama</h1>
        <h2>WEAVING THE TALE</h2>
        <h5>It is time to set out on a journey and tell the story
            of your Heroes, as they face perils and overcome
            obstacles in pursuit of their Quests – be they as humble
            as obtaining a neighbor’s baking recipe or as grand as
            defeating the Dark Mistress herself.</h5>

        This game is played as a conversation. The rules come in to help introduce
        unexpected outcomes and exciting developments. They focus on the Heroes,
        their journey, and their cinematic moments -- what matters for your story --
        rather than the numerical values of their qualities.
        The rules are also intentionally layered. Choosing between Simple, Quick,
        and Detailed outcomes allow you to control the pace, tension, and balance
        between weaving a narrative and tactical gameplay.

        Players, Heroes, Narrator, Challenges
        This chapter explains the rules of the game from the perspective of
        the players, who each take on the role of a Hero in the story.
        During play, the Narrator is responsible for introducing the
        scenario, for playing the NPCs and Challenges within each scene,
        and for acting as the referee of the game. Challenges are characters,
        obstacles, and forces that work against the Heroes. The role of the
        Narrator is explained in Volume II: The Narrator.
        Usually, the Narrator is one of the participants who does not portray
        a Hero, in the traditional style of tabletop roleplaying games.
        However, you can also use the Narrator rules in Vol. II to collectively
        act as the Narrator (co-op play) or to be your own Narrator (solo
        play), with The Oracle (Vol. II, page 238).
        Game Elements
        In the tutorial (page 10), you’ve learned about these basic game
        components:
        • Story tags, impermanent tags that describe items, resources, and
        allies received during the game
        • Statuses, special tags that describe temporary conditions and have
        a tier between 1 and 6
        • Limits, the maximum tier of a status a Hero or Challenge can take
        before being overcome or before something dramatic happens
        These elements will be mentioned throughout this chapter. They are
        fully explained later in this chapter (starting on page 164).

            <h3>DELVE DEEPER</h3>
            <p>Some sections of this chapter
                are shrouded and marked with
                a torch, indicating these are
                expanded rules or advanced
                concepts, beyond the basic rules.
                These can be easily skipped
                during your first few plays.
                Return to them when you’re
                curious about the further riches
                that lie beneath the surface.</p>
        </div>

        THE GAME LOOP
        Your game is played in sessions, usually taking several hours. In every
        session you play through one or more scenes. Scenes can join together
        to form a story with a beginning, middle, and end, called an adventure,
        and multiple adventures can combine into longer sagas, known as a
        series or campaign, played over many sessions.
        In each scene, the Heroes take turns acting, and each turn plays
        through these three steps:

        ESTABLISH
        The Narrator presents the scene, describing:
        • where your Heroes are and what is happening around them,
        • what the stakes are (why your Heroes are there and why it matters),
        • what the Challenges are (anything in your way to your goals), and
        what Threats are posed to your Heroes or their goals, if any.
        The Narrator then asks “What do you do?” and gives one Hero the
        spotlight, so everyone is now listening to them.

        ACTION
        When your Hero is in the spotlight, you describe what your Hero is doing in
        the scene, responding to all that has been Established.
        The Narrator may choose one of three ways to determine the outcome of the
        action: rule what happened or give you further details about the scene (Simple),
        ask you to roll the dice (Quick), or ask you to roll the dice and, if you succeed,
        spend your Power on Effects according to your Hero’s action (Detailed).

        CONSEQUENCES
        The Narrator delivers negative Consequences for your action if any of
        the following happened:
        • you ignored a Threat,
        • your roll generated Consequences,
        • the Narrator chooses to invoke your weakness tags for Consequences.
        The Narrator may add Effects.

        The Narrator may also allow you to lessen
        these Effects by making a reaction roll.

        These steps repeat. Following a Hero’s Action and Consequences,
        the Narrator re-establishes the scene and gives the spotlight to a
        different Hero (if there are multiple Heroes), who then takes Action
        and possibly generates Consequences.
        Together, this cycle is called a turn. When all the Heroes have had
        their turn, that’s a round. These terms are only for convenience and
        do not play a major role in the rules of the game.
        The scene ends when the Narrator says so: whether there is nothing
        else to do in the scene, all the Heroes left, or sometimes, for dramatic
        flair. Usually, this happens when the stakes have been won, lost, or
        deferred, and when all business in the scene has been concluded.
        The Challenges that Stand in Your Way
        Ultimately, in each scene, the Heroes attempt to reach their
        goals by overcoming what stands in their way – the Challenges.
        Depending on the story you tell and the specific scene, Challenges
        can be anything, from monsters, through dangerous terrain,
        to snoopy neighbours, or even having to craft a special gift for
        someone’s celebration.
        Challenges act by making Threats against your Hero during
        Establish and, if not stopped, by delivering Consequences. They
        don’t have their own turns. Before your turn, when Establishing
        the scene, the Narrator says “the monster prepares to lunge at you!”
        – that’s a Threat, but it’s still preventable. If you fail to stop this
        Threat with your next action, the Narrator might say “the monster
        snaps its jaws on your leg!” – these are the Consequences of not
        addressing that Threat.
        Challenges are overcome by taking action: either with a successful
        Quick action or by taking a Detailed action and giving the Challenge
        a status that meets or exceeds one of its Limits; it’s the Narrator’s
        decision. When you’re up against a Challenge, you can also take
        action to understand its abilities (Threats & Consequences) and how
        best to overcome it (Limits), again with either a Quick action or a
        Detailed one to discover valuable details.
        It’s very rare for a Narrator to allow a Hero to overcome a Challenge
        with a Simple action. Challenges are by definition dangerous and any
        engagement with them has an uncertain outcome, and so a roll will
        likely be involved.
        SCENES WITH LOW OR NO STAKES
        While the story is pushed forward by overcoming Challenges, many
        times the Narrator will have the Heroes spend a scene just talking
        with friends, or preparing themselves for future endeavours. In these
        low-stakes scenes the game loop progresses as normal, but there
        are no Threats, or only low-key ones. A camp or sojourn scene (page
        179) also typically lack stakes.

        <div class="side-comment">
            <p>Listen carefully to the
                Narrator Establishing
                the scene. They could be
                describing or even merely
                hinting at Threats, which, if
                overlooked, could lead to dire
                Consequences for your Hero.</p>
        </div>

        Managing The Spotlight
        It’s the Narrator’s choice who to give the spotlight to and therefore
        whose turn it is next. This decision can be based on the unique
        situation of each Hero in the scene, on dramatic considerations
        (what makes for better storytelling), or the players’ seating order.
        The Narrator should divide the spotlight judicially between all
        players, which often means completing a round before allowing a
        Hero to act again.
        A Hero can retain the spotlight for an additional action if they spend
        Power on an extra feat (page 157), and the Narrator may also
        choose to keep the spotlight on a Hero, for dramatic flair or to allow
        them to take a follow up action, such as after a prep action (Indirect
        Tags and Prep Actions, page 153).
        ACTING FIRST
        To see if your Hero acts before something or someone else, the Narrator
        may give you the spotlight and ask you to make a roll, usually with a
        Quick outcome and involving speed and vigilance. If you succeed, you
        may keep the spotlight and act before whatever else happens.
        This assumes your Hero has a reasonable chance at acting first.

        <div class="side-comment">
            <p>There is no turn order or
                “initiative roll” in this game –
                instead, the Narrator chooses
                who goes next similarly to
                a writer or a film director
                choosing what to focus on.</p>

        <h2>TAKING ACTION:<br> “WHAT DO YOU DO?”</h2>
        <p>As a player, your main role in the game is to listen to
            the narration of the scene and then, when the spotlight
            is yours, pick up the storytelling to describe what your
            Hero is thinking and feeling, and ultimately what they are
            driven to do – their action.</p>

        <h3>Describe Your Action</h3>

            by saying what you do.</p>
        <p>You are not limited to any predetermined set of

        <p>What you describe is what your Hero is
            trying to do; the Narrator and the rules of the
            game help determine the actual outcome
            of your action within your shared story.</p>

        <div class="side-comment">
            <p>An action can take any length of
                time — from the blink of an eye to
                several hours or more — as long as
                fits the overall pace of the scene.</p>
        </div>

        Determine The Outcome
        Next, the Narrator decides how to arrive at the outcome
        of your described action, choosing between three ways:
        THE SIMPLE WAY
        The Narrator considers the situation, the Hero’s tags,
        Challenges in the scene, the action's Might, and perhaps
        factors yet unknown to your Hero.
        The Narrator decides if the action ends with Success,
        Consequences, or both.
        The Narrator chooses the Simple way when:
        • The outcome of the action is certain (certain Success, certain
        failure, and/or certain Consequences) based on the inherent logic
        of the story.
        • The action is not yet dramatic enough to introduce the dice, and
        it's easier to just say what happens.

        <div class="rule-card">
            <h4><img class="icon-success">SUCCESS</h4>
            <p>The action unfolds as
                expected, or better,
                achieving its intended goal
                or overcoming an obstacle.
                The Narrator can also give
                you a useful tag or status.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-card">
            <h4><img class="icon-consequences">CONSEQUENCES (p.160)</h4>
            <p>The Narrator decides on
                a narrative development
                detrimental to the Hero,
                and can give or remove
                a tag or status in a way
                that hinders the Hero.</p>
        </div>

        THE QUICK WAY
        The Narrator asks you to make a roll to determine the outcome.
        Together, you count the action's Power by invoking relevant
        tags and statuses - yours, your target's, around you, etc.:
        • +1 Power for each helpful tag
        • -1 Power for each hindering tag
        • Add the tier of the highest helpful status
        • Subtract the tier of the highest hindering status
        • +/-3 Power or +/-6 Power for Might (page 171)
        You (the Hero) then roll two six-sided dice, add their results,
        add your Power, and compare the total to these categories.
        The Narrator chooses the Quick way to introduce an element of risk
        with the dice, while still keeping the story moving.
        Keep in Mind
        • The final Power may be zero or negative.
        • You can burn one tag for Power (page 158) to gain +3 Power instead of +1.
        • Rolling double ones (1 and 1) always means Consequences without
        Success, while rolling double sixes (6 and 6) always means Success
        without Consequences, regardless of Power.

        <div class="rule-card">
            <h4><img class="icon-success">10+</h4>
            <p>Success, as in Simple
                action. No Consequences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-card">
            <h4><img class="icon-successwithconsequences">9-7</h4>
            <p>Success & Consequences,

            <p>Consequences, as in Simple
                action. No Success.</p>
        </div>

        THE DETAILED WAY
        The Narrator asks you to count your Power and
        roll the dice as in the Quick way, above; if you achieve
        Success, you express it by choosing how to spend your
        Power on different game Effects (page 154).
        The Narrator chooses the Detailed way when they want to break the
        conflict down into a play-by-play, measure your success, or let you
        define your own success.
        Keep in Mind
        • When you Succeed you always have at least 1 Power to spend, even if
        you rolled with a Power of zero or less. (The Rule of Minimum One)
        • The chosen Effects must match the action described.

        <div class="rule-card">
            <h4><img class="icon-success">10+</h4>
            <p>SPEND YOUR POWER:
                • Add or scratch a
                tag (2 Power)
                • Add or reduce a status
                (1 Power per tier)
                • Discover a valuable
                detail (1 Power)
                See advanced options on page 154.
                No Consequences.</p>

            <p>Consequences, as in Simple
                action. No Success.</p>
        </div>

        Common Simple Actions
        Actions that center on perceiving the scene (looking, listening,
        smelling), moving around the scene, and talking to other
        characters, are all usually resolved using the Simple way.
        • You say “I look Around the corner," and the Narrator replies “You
        see a guard patrolling by the garden gate.”
        • You say “I walk over to the tavern bar," and the Narrator says “Okay.
        You’re there.”
        • You say “I say to Florian that he’s looking mighty grumpy this
        morning," and the Narrator says “Florian chuckles but then
        becomes serious and asks you where you were last night during the
        village prayer.”
        The exception is when these actions have some danger, drama,
        or difficulty in them, for example, discerning someone’s hidden
        feelings, running across a burning bridge, or convincing someone
        to do something they were not inclined to do. In such cases, the
        Narrator may opt for a Quick or Detailed outcome instead.
        The Narrator decides whether perceiving, moving, or talking to other
        characters ends your spotlight, or whether you can keep the spotlight
        – keep looking around, keep moving, keep talking – until it leads to a
        more dramatic action.

        <div class="side-comment">
            <h3>Cut To The Chase</h3>
            <p>The Narrator has the
                final word on which tags
                apply to your roll. A player
                can make their case but
                don’t spend too much time
                discussing tags – have the
                Narrator make a judgment
                call and move the game
                along. For a smooth game,
                it’s important to establish
                an understanding about
                your tags (page 78).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="side-comment">
            <p>Your Power may be
                further affected by
                Might (page 171).</p>
        </div>

        Counting Power
        When you use the Quick or Detailed outcome methods,
        your action’s Power is determined by all the tags and
        statuses that directly affect your action, positively or
        negatively: your own, your opponent’s or your target’s, or
        in the environment.
        For example, if your Hero is trying to carry a barrel of fish:
        • Being strong as an ox directly helps the action.
        • A barrel that is very heavy directly hinders the action.
        • Slippery cobblestones directly hinder the action.
        • Feeling invigorated-2 directly helps the action.
        • Being charming doesn’t help or hinder the action. It’s irrelevant.
        Whenever you count Power, you invoke (call out) all the positive or
        negative tags that directly affect it; the Narrator can invoke more tags
        in the scene, or invoke your weakness tags, if you didn’t do so. Then:
        • You gain 1 Power for each positive tag.
        • You lose 1 Power for each negative tag.
        • You add the tier of the highest positive status to your Power.
        • You subtract the tier of the highest negative status from your Power.
        The final Power may be zero or negative.
        Irrelevant tags don’t count and are simply ignored when counting
        Power.

        INDIRECT TAGS AND PREP ACTIONS
        Indirect tags are tags that are only somewhat relevant, or that feel
        like a stretch to apply because they describe something too general.
        They could affect the outcome, but something more is required to
        make them impactful – an extra step.
        To use them, you must first take a Detailed action and invoke
        these indirect tags to create new tags or statuses that are directly
        positive for your main action. For example, being resourceful doesn’t
        help you carry a barrel of fish, but you can use it to build or find a
        wheelbarrow that would be directly helpful for carrying the barrel.
        This type of action to create tags that will help another action is
        called a prep action.

        <div class="side-comment">
            <p>Broad tags (page 78) are
                more often indirectly helpful
                than directly helpful, which
                makes them slower and more
                risky to use, as they require
                an extra action, but they are
                more versatile and support
                many kinds of actions.</p>
            <p>After your prep action, the
                Narrator may choose to let you
                keep the spotlight and continue to
                your main action – or not.
                To guarantee this, you can spend
                1 Power on an extra feat
                (page 157) to keep the spotlight.</p>
