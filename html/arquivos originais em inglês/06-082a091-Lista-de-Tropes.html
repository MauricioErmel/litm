                <h3>Sweaty Smith.</h3>
                <p>Every day you work the bellows, pore over the
                    melting pot, and then shape the unyielding
                    metal, one hammer stroke after another, until
                    it’s ready to serve its purpose. Every night you
                    count your coin and count your blessings, setting
                    something aside for those who need it more,
                    with no inkling of what is to come. Soon, though,
                    everything will change, and you will be the one
                    forged in fire.</p>

                <p>You won’t believe the tales that circulate in
                    one small village! When the nights are long
                    and cold, there’s no harm in a bit of fictitious
                    entertainment. Sure, some get their feathers
                    ruffled, the more so if the rumor is true; but after
                    a while all is forgotten and forgiven. In truth, the
                    rumor mill is a way as old as time to keep watch
                    on those closest to you, a role you’ve undertaken
                    with great care.</p>

                    powerful of their kind know of your existence.
                    Perhaps it is best; the less of them feign to
