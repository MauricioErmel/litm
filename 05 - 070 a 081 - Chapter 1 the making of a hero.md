# Chapter 1: The Makings of a Hero.

## THE PROLOGUE: Hero & Fellowship Creation

### Before you begin your game, you need to gather a few details about each of the Heroes in the story and about their group, the Fellowship. Many game groups dedicate the entire first game session to this purpose, and call it Session Zero; here, we call it the Prologue.

Begin your Prologue by agreeing on the kind of story you’d like to tell (see some suggestions in the Introduction, page 54). Then, create your Heroes, starting on the next page, and finally create your Fellowship together (page 139).

### YOUR HERO.
A Hero’s details are recorded on cards:
- a **HERO CARD**, for their general details.
- four **THEME CARDS**, for their four main aspects.
- **TRACKING CARDS**, for their current conditions (statuses).

You can use a pre-generated Hero from the Character Pack, in which case all your cards are ready-made and collected in a folio. Or, you can create your own hero, recording their details on printed cards from the Theme Card Pack or on the character sheet at the back of this book.

Together, your heroes form a **Fellowship** (page 138), whose details are recorded on a shared card, **THE FELLOWSHIP CARD**.

#### The Hero Card.
This card records general details about your Hero: your name, your Hero’s name, their Fellowship relationships (page 138), Promise (page 193), and Moments of Fulfillment (page 193). If this is your first time learning the game, you should leave these additional Hero elements for last and read on. 

### Theme Cards. 
#### THEME TAGS.
**A THEME is built around a tag that describes a major aspect of your hero** such as their temperament, backstory, or abilities, such as <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black">**always attentive**</span>, <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black">**goat herder of Milkrest**</span>, or <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black">**gifted archer**</span>.
**Each theme has additional tags**, representing its title tag's minor, related, or secondary aspects. Tags are explained on page 76.

#### THEME TYPE.
Each of a Hero's themes has a type, which gives general guidance to its nature and how it develops. There are 20 theme types, divided into the three Might categories, which are explained later:
> **⸙ Origin themes** describe your background and beginnings, who you are as an individual. They are Circumstance, Devotion, Past, People, Personality, Skill or Trade, and Trait.
>
> **⚔ Adventure themes** describe what makes you a hero that stands out from the crowd, someone unique with the power to explore and impact a greater, more dangerous world. They are Duty, Influence, Knowledge, Prodigious Ability, Relic, and Uncanny Being.
>
> **♛ Greatness themes** describe what makes you a power unto yourself, capable of shaping the course of history. They are Destiny, Dominion, Mastery, and Monstrosity.

Three theme types could fit any of these categories, depending on what they describe: Companion, Magic, and Possessions.

Your Hero can have any mix of themes of different types and from all three categories. Your  choice of themes tell us what kind of Hero they are and their place in the world. 

#### MIGHT.
In some aspects of their life, your Hero is **Mighty** (page 171). When using themes with Might, your Hero is able to take grander actions and expect greater results – but they will also find themself preoccupied with bigger concerns and shouldering greater responsibilities. 

Your Hero’s choice of themes also reflects their general place within the imaginary world of your story, which can change as they evolve or replace themes. 

**If you have mostly Origin ⸙ themes**, you are a humble, rather unimportant individual who is often cast against stronger forces in a dangerous world. Your might is often in your heart, on a personal level, or in what is close to the ground, intimate, or underhanded.

**If you have mostly Adventure ⚔ themes**, you are a heroic or notable individual, able to contend with at least some of the many perils of the world. Your might is often in overcoming danger or adversity, and your troubles are of a greater order: monsters, villains, and considerable challenges.

**If you have mostly Greatness ♛ themes**, you are a force that can shape realms and the destinies of many. Your might is in exercising your power over the world, and your troubles are equally as grand, because your might attracts other powerful forces of the world to clash with you.

In a typical rustic fantasy game (page 62), all Heroes begin play with most or all of their themes being Origin. Discuss your option with the Narrator, to make sure your choices fit the Frame of Play (page 64) and Fellowship theme.

#### IMPROVING THE THEME.
During the game, your themes can grow. When you invoke a weakness tag, or Reflect during a camp scene (page 179), mark Improve. When the theme's third Improve is marked, it gains an improvement, which usually means you can add a new tag to it (page 187).

#### THE QUEST.
Each theme includes a quest, a goal, belief, or personal journey of your Hero that is related to this theme. Following or abandoning a theme's Quest (Quests & Transformations, page 188) can lead to a significant change: the replacement of the theme. Whenever you achieve a significant victory or success in your theme’s Quest, mark Milestone; after the third one, the theme evolves into a new one, developing further. Whenever you ignore the theme’s Quest or act against it, mark Abandon; after the third one, an aspect of you is lost, making room for a new one to develop.

After a theme is replaced, you gain Promise (page 193), representing how your Hero grows overall. Once you’ve marked Promise five times, you gain access to unique options that can truly transform your Hero.

> ### Your Story, Told Through Themes.
> Imagine a Hero that begins as a Miner who was taught to keep their head down and avoid making trouble. They spurn this norm and lead a revolt in the mines, replacing their Miner theme with a Revolt Leader theme, learning warfare and politics. Later, they may choose to return to the simple life of a miner again, or evolve to become the leader of a realm-wide rebellion.

> ### Your Story, Developed by you.
> Your Hero's advancement is in your hand. While the Narrator may present opportunities for your Hero to grow, it is up to you to bring your Hero's weaknesses and Quests into the limelight.

### Tags.
Tags are short descriptors (usually 1-3 words) that define important details in the story. 

They can describe almost anything including abilities, background, items, beings, resources, mental faculties, relationships, style, and more, as well as weaknesses, limitations, and flaws.

Tags have a dual role: they **define what’s true in the story**, and they **add or reduce the Power** from your Hero’s actions. When something is described as a tag, it's therefore important. 

**A tag’s relevance and usefulness is always determined in the context of what you’re doing now**. A tag can be useful for one action and not useful for another, e.g., <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black; font-style: italic">keen hearing</span> can be useful for hunting but not for running, and it can be hindering when trying to ignore a screeching, discordant sound.

**All tags are always worth 1 Power**. A <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black; font-style: italic">dagger</span> and a <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black; font-style: italic">greatsword</span> are both worth 1 Power, but each can or cannot be used beneficially in different actions and different situations.

#### YOUR HERO’S TAGS.
**POWER TAGS** are permanent tags of your Hero that describe **something that’s mostly useful**. They cannot be used against you (the Narrator can rule differently, on rare occasions). Your themes, and most tags included in them, are power tags.

**WEAKNESS TAGS** are permanent tags of your Hero that describe **something limiting**. They cannot be used in your favor (the Narrator can rule differently, on rare occasions). However, whenever a weakness tag is invoked, its theme gains Improve, so they are your main tool for **Improving** your Hero.

#### YOUR BACKPACK.
The backpack section of your Hero card is simply a space to record temporary tags that you collect during the story known as **story tags** (page 164), especially those representing items you have packed for the journey but also anything you have prepared, for example, songs you practiced or incantations you memorized.

You begin the game with **one** story tag in your backpack. Your Hero may be carrying other things, but as long as they are not represented by a tag, their importance and ability to shape the story is up to the Narrator.

#### SCRATCHED TAGS.
A scratched power tag becomes unavailable. Recovering a tag typically requires taking an action, or a good rest (**Camping & Sojourns**, page 179). A scratched story tag is removed. Weakness tags cannot usually be scratched.

To mark a tag as scratched, circle its icon. Erase the circle when the tag is recovered.

### HERO CREATION.
You can create any hero you can  dream of, by describing them with tags. 

#### The Simplest Way:</br>JustWrite It Down.
- Think of their four themes and write them as power tags.
- Add two more power tags and one weakness tag to each theme.
- Write a Quest for each theme, and choose a theme type.
- Create one backpack tag.

#### The Quickes Way:</br>Pick A Trope.
A trope is like a recipe for a Hero. The tropes begin on page 82.
- Pick a trope, and write down its three listed themes.
- Choose a fourth theme from the list.
- Each theme points you at a theme kit, a premade list of tags, from which you choose the theme’s additional tags (two power tags and one weakness) and record your Quest.
- Choose one backpack tag.

#### The Detailed Way:</br>Answer Themebook Questions.
A **themebook** is a questionnaire that walks you through the creation of a theme, and helps you think of the concept behind each choice. The themebooks begin on page 92.
- Choose four theme types (you can repeat a type).
- Answer the questions in each theme’s themebook, to create tags. You must answer the first question (in bold) in each themebook, and then two more of your choice (you can repeat a question), to create power tags. Also answer one weakness tag question of your choice.
- Use the suggestions in the themebook and on the next page to come up with a Quest.
- Peruse the **General Store** (page 132) to pick out one backpack tag.

You can also mix and match these methods, such as by choosing a trope but answer themebook questions instead of using theme kits, or creating some themes from themebooks and some from theme kits.

#### How To Choose Themes
Every Hero has a past, some have a trade or skill, and most have unique traits and possessions, but not every one of these details should become a theme.

Choosing themes is choosing what to highlight about your Hero, what is most important in the beginning of their story. Remember that, later, these themes might change, shifting the story’s focus to new aspects of your Hero.

#### Hero Creation Checklist
While you’re creating your Hero, remember the following:
- **Your power tags should be useful.**</br>
Ask yourself: “What kind of actions would this tag support?”

- **Your weakness tags should be limiting.**</br>
Ask yourself: “What kind of actions would this tag hinder?” or “How or when would it cause problems for my Hero?”

- **Your tags, especially the title of each theme, should match the Might of their theme.**</br>
Greatness theme tags should be grandiose like queen of the realm or spell of annihilation; Adventure theme tags should describe something above the ordinary, such as remarkable swordfighter or blessing of the gods; while Origin theme tags should be ordinary like humble gravedigger or local gossip.

- **Your Quests should be clear.**</br>
Most Quests fall into one or more of these categories:

    - Your Wish: Something you long for or aspire to.
    - Your Truth: A statement you believe in and want to uphold.
    - Your Home: Something you endeavor regularly to preserve.
    - Your Question: Something you yearn to know above all.</br>
    Ask yourself: “What could be a Milestone for this Quest?” and “What kind of actions would be considered Abandoning this Quest?” Further advice appears under Types of Quests (page 188).

- **You and the Narrator must have an understanding about your tags and Quests.**</br>
Agree in advance on what each means, what they represent and when and how they can be used.  Talk about which tags are directly helpful to an action and which are only relevant in an indirect or roundabout way. This will be important during play.
- **Note which tags are broad and which are specific.**</br>
Tags like <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black; font-style: italic">clever</span> or <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black; font-style: italic">wizard</span> or <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black; font-style: italic">rich</span> are broad, meaning they can be used in a wide variety of situations and actions. Because of this, they usually require an extra action to use (see Indirect Tags and Prep Actions, page 153). Specific tags like <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black; font-style: italic">whirlwind slash</span> or </span>sleeping spell</span> can be used directly, but only in appropriate situations, so they are more focused and reliable. Try to have a balance of broad, specific, and somewhere-in-between tags.</br>
The Narrator may limit the number of broad tags you have. They may also deem some tags, such as <span style="background-color: khaki; color: black; font-style: italic">lucky</span>, as too broad to have in the game, or alternatively as inherently indirect, so that they always require an extra action to use.

#### Your Quests Become Your Hero’s Journey
During play, the Narrator will both challenge your Quests and present you with opportunities to advance them, pushing your Hero to mark Abandon or Milestone and undergo dramatic transformations. Your choice of Quests lets the Narrator know what possible story arcs you’d like to explore for your character. See Gerrin’s Quests in the tutorial as an example (page 52).

#### The Classic RPG Build
If you’re coming from classic RPGs and would like to start with something familiar, use the following four themes for your character:

- People for your ancestry or race (Uncanny Being if your ancestry is considered supernatural).
- Trait for your primary or best attribute.
- Skill or Trade for your class (Prodigious Ability if creating a PC level 5 or higher).
- Circumstance for your background.

### THEME TYPE LIST.
This list of theme types is not finite or comprehensive, and many of them overlap, looking at the same aspect from different angles. It represents the character aspects you are most likely to need when making your Hero, but you can also write up your own theme types.

#### CHANGING A THEME’S MIGHT
Most theme types are presented as belonging to a Might category, but these guidelines don't have to be followed if you and your Narrator both agree to it. You might wish to have a Relic that can tear continents (Greatness), play as an Uncanny Being that isn’t all that special (Origin), or have a Past worthy of an epic (Greatness). Just remember to phrase your tags in a manner that suits the Might you chose.

#### Making Themes Magical

While the Magic theme type is the most direct way to represent magical abilities, you can incorporate magical elements into any theme or tag, depending on your group’s story (with Narrator approval).

For example:
- Devotion can be used to represent simple, faith-related magic.
- People can be used for magic that is inherent to your ancestry or culture.
- Trait can be used for a simple yet unique magical ability.
